<h2 class="p6">PREFACE</h2>

<p>Although the reader will quickly make
the discovery for himself, I should like
here to emphasise the fact that this is a book
about Paris and the Parisians written wholly
from the outside, and containing only so much
of that city and its citizens as a foreigner
who has no French friends may observe on
holiday visits.</p>

<p>I express elsewhere my indebtedness to a
few French authors. I have also been greatly
assisted in a variety of ways, but especially
in the study of the older Paris streets, by
my friend Mr. Frank Holford.</p>

<p><span class="flright">E. V. L.</span></p>

<p class="center p2 b1">NOTE</p>

<p>Since this new edition was prepared for the press
the devastating theft of Leonardo da Vinci's "Monna
Lisa" was perpetrated. Pages 81-87 therefore&mdash;describing
that picture as one of the chief treasures
of the Louvre&mdash;must change their tense to the past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">1</a></span></p>
<p class="blockquot">
The Gare du Nord and Gare St. Lazare&mdash;The Singing Cabman&mdash;"Vivent
les femmes!"&mdash;Characteristic Paris&mdash;The Next Morning&mdash;A
Choice of Delights&mdash;The Compas d'Or&mdash;The World of Dumas&mdash;The
First Lunch&mdash;Voisin wins.
</p>

<p>Most travellers from London enter Paris in the
evening, and I think they are wise. I wish it
were possible again and again to enter Paris in the
evening for the first time; but since it is not, let me
hasten to say that the pleasure of re-entering Paris
in the evening is one that custom has almost no power
to stale. Every time that one emerges from the Gare
du Nord or the Gare St. Lazare one is taken afresh by
the variegated and vivid activity of it all&mdash;the myriad
purposeful self-contained bustling people, all moving
on their unknown errands exactly as they were moving
when one was here last, no matter how long ago. For
Paris never changes: that is one of her most precious
secrets.</p>

<p>The London which one had left seven or eight hours
before was populous enough and busy enough, Heaven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
knows, but London's pulse is slow and fairly regular,
and even at her gayest, even when greeting Royalty,
she seems to be advising caution and a careful demeanour.
But Paris&mdash;Paris smiles and Paris sings.
There is an incredible vivacity in her atmosphere.</p>

<p>Sings! This reminds me that on the first occasion
that I entered Paris&mdash;in the evening, of course&mdash;my
cabman sang. He sang all the way from the Gare du
Nord to the Rue Caumartin. This seemed to me
delightful and odd, although at first I felt in danger of
attracting more attention than one likes; but as we
proceeded down the Rue Lafayette&mdash;which nothing but
song and the fact that it is the high road into Paris
from England can render tolerable&mdash;I discovered that no
one minded us. A singing cabman in London would
bring out the Riot Act and the military; but here he
was in the picture: no one threw at the jolly fellow
any of the chilling deprecatory glances which are the
birthright of every light-hearted eccentric in my own
land. And so we proceeded to the hotel, often escaping
collision by the breadth of a single hair, the driver singing
all the way. What he sang I knew not; but I doubt
if it was of battles long ago: rather, I should fancy,
of very present love and mischief. But how fitting a
first entry into Paris!</p>

<p>An hour or so later&mdash;it was just twenty years ago,
but I remember it so clearly&mdash;I observed written up in
chalk in large emotional letters on a public wall the
words "Vivent les femmes!" and they seemed to me also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
so odd&mdash;it seemed to me so funny that the sentiment
should be recorded at all, since women were obviously
going to live whatever happened&mdash;that I laughed aloud.
But it was not less characteristic of Paris than the
joyous baritone notes that had proceeded from beneath
the white tall hat of my cocher. It was as natural for
one Parisian to desire the continuance of his joy as
a lover, even to expressing it in chalk in the street, as
to another to beguile with lyrical snatches the tedium
of cab-driving.</p>

<p>I was among the Latin people, and, as I quickly
began to discover, I was myself, for the first time, a
foreigner. That is a discovery which one quickly makes
in Paris.</p>

<p>But I have not done yet with the joy of entering and
re-entering Paris in the evening&mdash;after the long smooth
journey across the marshes of Picardy or through the
orchards of Normandy and the valley of the Seine&mdash;whichever
way one travels. But whether one travels by
Calais, Boulogne, Dieppe or Havre, whether one alights
at the Gare du Nord or St. Lazare, once outside the
station one is in Paris instantly: there is no debatable
land between either of these termini and the city, as
there is, for example, between the Gare de Lyons and
the city. Paris washes up to the very platforms. A
few steps and here are the foreign tables on the pavements
and the foreign waiters, so brisk and clean,
flitting among them; here are the vehicles meeting and
passing on the wrong or foreign side, and beyond that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
knowing apparently no law at all; here are the deep-voiced
newsvendors shouting those magic words <i>La
Patrie!</i> <i>La Patrie!</i> which, should a musician ever write
a Paris symphony, would recur and recur continually
beneath its surface harmonies. And here, everywhere,
are the foreign people in their ordered haste and their
countless numbers.</p>

<p>The pleasure of entering and re-entering Paris in the
evening is only equalled by the pleasure of stepping
forth into the street the next morning in the sparkling
Parisian air and smelling again the pungent Parisian
scent and gathering in the foreign look of the place.
I know of no such exuberance as one draws in with
these first Parisian inhalations on a fine morning in May
or June&mdash;and in Paris in May and June it is always fine,
just as in Paris in January and February it is always cold
or wet. His would be a very sluggish or disenchanted
spirit who was not thus exhilarated; for here at his feet
is the holiday city of Europe and the clean sun over all.</p>

<p>And then comes the question "What to do?" Shall
we go at once to "Monna Lisa"? But could there
be a better morning for the children in the Champs-Elysées?
That beautiful head in the His de la Salle
collection&mdash;attributed to the school of Fabriano! How
delightfully the sun must be lighting up the red walls of
the Place des Vosges! Rodin's "Kiss" at the Luxembourg&mdash;we
meant to go straight to that! The wheel
window in Notre Dame, in the north transept&mdash;I have
been thinking of that ever since we planned to come.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span></p>

<p>So may others talk and act; but I have no hesitancies.
My duty is clear as crystal. On the first morning
I pay a visit of reverence and delight to the ancient
auberge of the Compas d'Or at No. 64 Rue Montorgeuil.
And this I shall always do until it is razed to
the earth, as it seems likely to be under the gigantic
scheme, beyond Haussmann almost, which is to renovate
the most picturesque if the least sanitary portions of
old Paris at a cost of over thirty millions of pounds.
Unhappy day&mdash;may it be long postponed! For some
years now I have always approached the Compas d'Or
with trembling and foreboding. Can it still be there?
I ask myself. Can that wonderful wooden hanger that
covers half the courtyard have held so long? Will
there be a motor-car among the old diligences and
waggons? But it is always the same.</p>

<p>From the street&mdash;and the Rue Montorgeuil is as a
whole one of the most picturesque and characteristic
of the older streets of Paris, with its high white houses,
each containing fifty families, its narrowness, its barrows
of fruit and green stuff by both pavements, and
its crowds of people&mdash;from the street, the Compas d'Or
is hardly noticeable, for a butcher and a cutler occupy
most of its façade; but the sign and the old carvings
over these shops give away the secret, and you pass
through one of the narrow archways on either side and
are straightway in a romance by the great Dumas. Into
just such a courtyard would D'Artagnan have dashed,
and leaping from one sweating steed leap on another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
and be off again amid a shower of sparks on the stones.
Time has stood still here.</p>

<p>There is no other such old inn left. The coach to
Dreux&mdash;now probably a carrier's cart&mdash;still regularly
runs from this spot, as it has done ever since the beginning
of the sixteenth century. Rows of horses
stand in its massive stables and fill the air with their
warm and friendly scent; a score of ancient carts huddle
in the yard, in a corner of which there will probably
be a little group of women shelling peas; beneath the
enormous hanger are more vehicles, and masses of hay
on which the carters sleep. The ordinary noise of
Paris gives way, in this sanctuary of antiquity, to the
scraping of hoofs, the rattle of halter bolts, and the
clatter of the wooden shoes of ostlers. It is the past in
actual being&mdash;Civilisation, like Time, has stood still in
the yard of the Compas d'Or. That is why I hasten to
it so eagerly and shall always do so until it disappears
for ever. There is nothing else in Paris like it.</p>

<p>And after? Well, the next thing is to have lunch.
And since this lunch&mdash;being the first&mdash;will be the best
lunch of the holiday and therefore the best meal of the
holiday (for every meal on a holiday in Paris is a little
better than that which follows it), it is an enterprise
not lightly to be undertaken. One must decide carefully,
for this is to be an extravagance: the search for the
little out-of-the-way restaurant will come later. To-day
we are rich.</p>

<p>This book is not a guide for the gastronome and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
gourmet. How indeed could it be, even although
when heaven sends a cheerful hour one would scorn to
refrain? Yet none the less it would be pleasant in
this commentary upon a city illustrious for its culinary
ingenuity and genius to say something of restaurants.
But what is one to say here on such a theme? Volumes
are needed. Every one has his own taste. For me
Voisin's remains, and will, I imagine, remain the most
distinguished, the most serene, restaurant in Paris, in
its retired situation at the corner of the Rue Saint-Honoré
and the Rue Cambon, with its simple decoration, its
unhastening order and despatch, its Napoleonic head-waiter,
its Bacchic wine-waiter (with a head that calls
for vine leaves) and its fastidious cuisine. To Voisin's
I should always make my way when I wished not only
to be delicately nourished but to be quiet and philosophic
and retired. Only one other restaurant do I
know where the cooking gives me the satisfaction of
Voisin's&mdash;where excessive richness never intrudes&mdash;and
that is a discovery of my own and not lightly to be
given away. Voisin's is a name known all over the
world: one can say nothing new about Voisin's; but
the little restaurant with which I propose to tantalise
you, although the resort of some of the most thoughtful
eaters in Paris, has a reputation that has not spread.
It is not cheap, it is little less dear indeed than the
Café Anglais or Paillard's, to name the two restaurants
of renown which are nearest to it; its cellar is poor and
limited to half a dozen wines; its two rooms are minute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
and hot; but the idea of gastronomy reigns&mdash;everything
is subordinated to the food and the cooking. If you
order a trout, it is the best trout that France can breed,
and it is swimming in the kitchen at the time the
solitary waiter repeats your command; no such asparagus
reaches any other Paris restaurant, no such Pré Salé
and no such wild strawberries. But I have said enough;
almost I fear I have said too much. These discoveries
must be kept sacred.</p>

<p>And for lunch to-day? Shall it be chez Voisin, or
chez Foyot, by the Sénat, or chez Lapérouse (where the
two Stevensons used to eat and talk) on the Quai des
Augustins? Or shall it be at my nameless restaurant?</p>

<p>Voisin's to-day, I think.</p>

THE ILE DE LA CITÉ</h2>

and Comic&mdash;The Only Joke&mdash;The English and the French.</p>

<p>Where to begin? That is a problem in the writing
of every book, but peculiarly so with Paris;
because, however one may try to be chronological, the
city is such a blend of old and new that that design
is frustrated at every turn. Nearly every building of
importance stands on the site of some other which
instantly jerks us back hundreds of years, while if we
deal first with the original structure, such as the remains
of the Roman Thermes at the Cluny, built about
300, straightway the Cluny itself intrudes, and we leap
from the third century to the nineteenth; or if we trace
the line of the wall of Philip Augustus we come swiftly
to so modern an institution as the Mont-de-Piété; or
if we climb to such a recent thoroughfare as the Boulevard
de Clichy, with its palpitatingly novel cabarets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
and allurements, we must in order to do so ascend a
mountain which takes its name from the martyrdom
of St. Denis and his companions in the third century.
It is therefore well, since Paris is such a tangle of past
and present, to disregard order altogether and to let
these pages reflect her character. Expect then, dear
reader, to be twitched about the ages without mercy.</p>

<p>Let us begin in earnest by leaving the mainland and
adventuring upon an island. For the heart of Paris is
enisled: Notre Dame, Sainte Chapelle, the Palais de
Justice, the Hôtel Dieu, the Préfecture de Police, the
Morgue&mdash;all are entirely surrounded by water. The
history of the Cité is the history of Paris, almost the
history of France.</p>

<p>Paris, the home of the Parisii, consisted of nothing
but this island when Julius Cæsar arrived there with
his conquering host. The Romans built their palace
here, and here Julian the Apostate loved to sojourn.
It was in Julian's reign that the name was changed
from Lutetia (which it is still called by picturesque
writers) to Parisea Civitas, from which Paris is an easy
derivative. The Cité remained the home of government
when the Merovingians under Clovis expelled the
Romans, and again under the Carlovingians. The
second Royal Palace was begun by the first of the
Capets, Hugh, in the tenth century, and it was completed
by Robert the Pious in the eleventh. Louis
VII. decreed Notre Dame; but it was Saint Louis,
reigning from 1226 to 1270, who was the father of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
Cité as we now know it. He it was who built Sainte
Chapelle, and it was he who surrendered part of the
Palace to the Law.</p>

<p>While it was the home of the Court and the Church
the island naturally had little enough room for ordinary
residents, who therefore had to live, whether aristocrats
or tradespeople, on the mainland, either on the north
or south side of the river. The north side was for the
most part given to merchants, the south to scholars,
for Saint Louis was the builder not only of Sainte
Chapelle but also of the Sorbonne. Very few of the
smaller buildings of that time now remain: the oldest
Paris that one now wanders in so delightedly, whether
on the north bank or the south, whether near the
Sorbonne or the Hôtel de Sens, dates, with a few
fortunate exceptions, from the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries.</p>

<p>Nowhere may the growth of Paris be better observed
and better understood than on the highest point on this
Island of the City&mdash;on the summit of Notre Dame.
Standing there you quickly comprehend the Paris of
the ages: from Cæsar's Lutetia, occupying the island
only and surrounded by fields and wastes, to the Paris of
this year of our Lord, spreading over the neighbouring
hills, such a hive of human activity and energy as will
hardly bear thinking of&mdash;a Paris which has thrown off the
yoke not only of the kings that once were all-powerful but
of the Church too.</p>

<p>By the twelfth century the kings of France had begun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
to live in smaller palaces more to their personal
taste, such as the Hôtel Barbette, the Hôtel de Sens
(much of which still stands, as a glass factory, at the
corner of the Rue de l'Hôtel de Ville and the Rue de
Figuier, one of the oldest of the Paris mansions), the
Hôtel de Bourgogne (in the Rue Etienne Marcel: you
may still see its tower of Jean Sans Peur), the Hôtel
de Nevers (what remains of which is at the corner of
the Rue Colbert and Rue Richelieu), and, of course,
the Louvre. Charles VII. (1422-1461) was the first
king to settle at the Louvre permanently.</p>

<p>To gain the Ile de la Cité we leave the mainland
of Paris at the Quai du Louvre, and make our crossing
by the Pont Neuf. Neuf no longer, for as a matter of
historical fact it is now the oldest of all the Paris bridges:
that is, in its foundations, for the visible part of it has
been renovated quite recently. The first stone of it
was laid by Henri III. in 1578: it was not ready for
many years, but in 1603 Henri IV. (of Navarre) ventured
across a plank of it on his way to the Louvre,
after several previous adventurers had broken their
necks in the attempt. "So much the less kings they,"
was his comment. He lived to see the bridge finished.</p>

<p>Behind the statue of this monarch, whom the
French still adore, is the garden that finishes off the
west end of the Ile very prettily, sending its branches
up above the parapet. Here we may stop; for
we are now on the Island itself, midway between the
two halves of the bridge, and the statue has such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
a curious history, so typical of the French character,
that I should like to tell it. The original bronze figure,
erected by Louis XIII. in 1614, was taken down in 1792,
a time of stress, and melted into a commodity that was
then of vastly greater importance than the effigies of
kings&mdash;namely cannon. (As we shall see in the course
of this book, Paris left the hands of the Revolutionaries
a totally different city from the Paris of 1791.) Then
came peace again, and then came Napoleon, and in the
collection at the Archives is to be seen a letter written
by the Emperor from Schönbrunn, on August 15th, 1809,
stating that he wishes an obelisk to be erected on the site
of the Henri IV. statue&mdash;an obelisk of Cherbourg granite,
180 pieds d'élévation, with the inscription "l'Empereur
Napoléon au Peuple Français". That, however, was not
done.</p>

<p>Time passed on, Napoleon fell, and Louis XVIII.
returned from his English home to the throne of France,
and was not long in perpetrating one of those symmetrical
ironical jests which were then in vogue. Taking
from the Vendôme column the bronze statue of Napoleon
(who was safely under the thumb of Sir Hudson Lowe
at St. Helena, well out of mischief), and to this adding
a second bronze statue of the same usurper intended for
some other site, the monarch directed that they should
be melted into liquid from which a new statue of Henri
IV.&mdash;the very one at which we are at this moment
gazing&mdash;should be cast. It was done, and though to
the Röntgen-rayed vision of the cynic it may appear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
to be nothing more or less than a double Napoleon,
it is to the world at large Henri IV., the hero of
Ivry.</p>

<p>I have seen comparisons between the Seine and the
Thames; but they are pointless. You cannot compare
them: one is a London river, and the other is a Paris
river. The Seine is a river of light; the Thames is a river
of twilight. The Seine is gay; the Thames is sombre.
When dusk falls in Paris the Seine is just a river in the
evening; when dusk falls in London the Thames becomes
a wonderful mystery, an enchanted stream in a land of
old romance. The Thames is, I think, vastly more
beautiful; but on the other hand, the Thames has no
merry passenger steamers and no storied quais. The
Seine has all the advantage when we come to the consideration
of what can be done with a river's banks in
a great city. For the Seine has a mile of old book and
curiosity stalls, whereas the Thames has nothing.</p>

<p>And yet the coping of the Thames embankment is as
suitable for such a purpose as that of the Seine, and as
many Londoners are fond of books. How is it? Why
should all the bookstalls and curiosity stalls of London
be in Whitechapel and Farringdon Street and the Cattle
Market? That is a mystery which I have never solved
and never shall. Why are the West Central and the
West districts wholly debarred&mdash;save in Charing Cross
Road, and that I believe is suspect&mdash;from loitering at
such alluring street banquets? It is beyond understanding.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span></p>

<p>The history of the stall-holders of the quais has been
told very engagingly by M. Octave Uzanne, whom one
might describe as the Austin Dobson and the Augustine
Birrell of France, in his work <i>Bouquinistes et Bouquineurs</i>.
They established themselves first on the Pont Neuf, but
in 1650 were evicted. (The Paris bridges, I might say
here, become at the present time the resort of every kind
of pedlar directly anything occurs to suspend their
traffic.)</p>

<p>The parapets of the quais then took the place of those
of the bridge, and there the booksellers' cases have been
ever since. But no longer are they the gay resort that
once they were. It was considered, says M. Uzanne,
writing of the eighteenth century, "quite the correct
thing for the promenaders to gossip round the bookstalls
and discuss the wit and fashionable writings of
the day. At all hours of the day these quarters were
much frequented, above all by literary men, lawyers
clerks and foreigners. One historical fact, not generally
known, merits our attention, for it shows that not
only the libraries and the stall-keepers assisted in drawing
men of letters to the vicinity of the Hôtel Mazarin,
but there also existed a 'rendez-vous' for the sale of
English and French journals. It was, in fact, at the
corner of the Rue Dauphine and the Quai Conti that
the first establishment known as the Café Anglais was
started. One read in big letters on the signboard:
Café Anglais&mdash;Becket, propriétaire. This was the meeting
place of the greater part of English writers visiting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
Paris who wished to become acquainted with the literary
men of the period, the encyclopædists and poets of the
Court of Louis XV. This Café offered to its habitués
the best-known English papers of the day, the <i>Westminster
Gazette</i>, the <i>London Evening Post</i>, the <i>Daily
Advertiser</i>, and the various pamphlets published on the
other side of the Channel....</p>

<p>"You must know that the Quai Conti up to the year
1769 was only a narrow passage leading down to a place
for watering horses. Between the Pont Neuf and the
building known as the Château-Gaillard at the opening
of the Rue Guénégaud, were several small shops, and a
small fair continually going on.</p>

<p>"This Château-Gaillard, which was a dependency of
the old Porte de Nesle, had been granted by Francis I.
to Benvenuto Cellini. The famous Florentine goldsmith
received visits from the Sovereign protector of
arts and here executed the work he had been ordered to
do, under his Majesty's very eyes....</p>

<p>"One calls to mind that Sterne, in his delightful
<i>Sentimental Journey</i>, was set down in 1767 at the Hôtel
de Modène, in the Rue Jacob, opposite the Rue des Deux-Anges,
and one has not forgotten his love for the quais
and the adventure which befell him while chatting to a
bookseller on the Quai Conti, of whom he wished to buy
a copy of Shakespeare so that he might read once more
Polonius' advice to his son before starting on his travels.</p>

<p>"Diderot, in his <i>Salon</i> of 1761, relates his flirtation
with the pretty girl who served in one of these shops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
and afterwards became the wife of Menze. 'She called
herself Miss Babuti and kept a small book shop on the
Quai des Augustins, spruce and upright, white as a lily
and red as a rose. I would enter her shop, in my own
brisk way: "Mademoiselle, the 'Contes de la Fontaine'
... a 'Petronius' if you please."&mdash;"Here you are, Sir.
Do you want any other books?"&mdash;"Forgive me, yes"&mdash;"What
is it?"&mdash;"La 'Religieuse en Chemise.'"&mdash;"For
shame, Sir! Do you read such trash?"&mdash;"Trash,
is it, Mademoiselle? I did not know...."'"</p>

<p>M. Uzanne's pages are filled with such charming
gossip and with character-sketches of the most famous
booksellers and book-hunters. One pretty trait that
would have pleased Mary Lamb (and perhaps did, in
1822, when her brother took her to the "Boro' side of
the Seine") is mentioned by M. Uzanne: "The stall-keeper
on the quais always has an indulgent eye for
the errand boy or the little bonne [slavey] who stops in
front of his stall and consults gratis 'La Clef des Songes'
or 'Le Secrétaire des Dames'. Who would not commend
him for this kind toleration? In fact it is very
rare to find the bookseller in such cases not shutting
his eyes&mdash;metaphorically&mdash;and refraining from walking
up to the reader, for fear of frightening her away.
And then the young girl moves off with a light step,
repeating to herself the style of letter or the explanation
of a dream, rich in hope and illusions for the rest of the
day."</p>

<p>But the best description of the book-hunter of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
quais is that given to Dumas by Charles Nodier. "This
animal," he said, "has two legs and is featherless,
wanders usually up and down the quais and the boulevards,
stopping at all the old bookstalls, turning over
every book on them; he is habitually clad in a coat
that is too long for him and trousers that are too short;
he always wears on his feet shoes that are down at the
heel, a dirty hat on his head, and, under his coat and
over his trousers, a waistcoat fastened together with
string. One of the signs by which he can be recognised
is that he never washes his hands."</p>

<p>Henri IV.'s statue faces the Place Dauphine and the
west façade of the Palais de Justice. At No. 28 in the
Place Dauphine Madame Roland was born, little thinking
she was destined one day to be imprisoned in the
neighbouring Conciergerie, which, to those who can
face the difficulties of obtaining a ticket of admission,
is one of the most interesting of the Island's many interesting
buildings. But the process is not easy, and
there is only one day in the week on which the prison
is shown.</p>

<p>The tickets are issued at the Préfecture of Police&mdash;the
Scotland Yard of Paris&mdash;which is the large building
opposite Sainte Chapelle. One may either write or call.
I advise writing; for calling is not as simple as it
sounds: simplicity and sightseeing in Paris being indeed
not on the best terms. It was not until I had asked
five several officials that I found even the right door
of the vast structure, and then having passed a room
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
full of agents (or policemen) smoking and jesting, and
having climbed to a third storey, I was in danger of losing
for ever the privilege of seeing what I had fixed my
mind upon, wholly because, although I knew the name
and street of my hotel, I did not know its number.
Who ever dreamed that hotels have numbers? Has the
Savoy a number in the Strand? Is the Ritz numbered
in Piccadilly? Not that I was living in any such
splendour, but still, on the face of it, a hotel has a name
because it has no number. "C'est égal," the gentleman
said at last, after a pantomime of impossibility and
reproach, and I took my ticket, bowed to the ground,
replaced my hat and was free to visit the Conciergerie
on the morrow. Such are the amenities of the tourist's
life.</p>

<p>Let me here say that the agents of Paris are by far
its politest citizens, and in appearance the healthiest.
I have never met an uncivil agent, and I once met one
who refused a tip after he had been of considerable
service to me. Never did I attempt to tip another.
They have their defects, no doubt: they have not the
authority that we give our police: their management
of traffic is pathetically incompetent; but they are street
gentlemen and the foreigner has no better friend.</p>

<p>The Conciergerie is the building on the Quai de l'Horloge
with the circular towers beneath extinguishers&mdash;an
impressive sight from the bridges and the other bank of
the river. Most of its cells are now used as rooms for
soldiers (André Chénier's dungeon is one of their kitchens);
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
but a few rooms of the deepest historical interest have
been left as they were. These are displayed by a listless
guide who rises to animation only when the time comes
to receive his bénéfice and offer for sale a history of his
preserves.</p>

<p>One sees first the vaulted Salle Saint Louis, called the
Salle des Pas Perdus because it was through it that the
victims of the Revolution walked on their way to the
Cour de Mai and execution. The terribly significant
name has since passed to the great lobby of the Palais
de Justice immediately above it, where it has less appropriateness.
It is of course the cell of Marie Antoinette
that is the most poignant spot in this grievous place.
When the Queen was here the present room was only
about half its size, having a partition across it, behind
which two soldiers were continually on guard, day and
night. The Queen was kept here, suffering every kind
of indignity and petty tyranny, from early September,
1793, until October 16th. Her chair, in which she sat
most of the time, faced the window of the courtyard.</p>

<p>A few acts of kindness reached her in spite of the
vigilance of the authorities; but very few. I quote
the account of two from the official guide, a poor
thing, which I was weak enough to buy: "The Queen
had no complaint to make against the concierges
Richard nor their successors the Baults. It is told
that one day Richard asked a fruitseller in the
neighbourhood to select him the best of her melons,
whatever it might cost. 'It is for a very important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
personage, then?' said the seller disdainfully, looking at
the concierge's threadbare clothes. 'Yes,' said he, 'it is
for some one who was once very important; she is so no
longer; it is for the Queen.' 'The Queen,' exclaimed the
tradeswoman, turning over all her melons, 'the Queen!
Oh, poor woman! Here, make her eat that, and I won't
have you pay for it....'</p>

<p>"One of the gendarmes on duty having smoked during
the night, learnt the following day that the Queen,
whom he noticed was very pale, had suffered from the
smell of the tobacco; he smashed his pipe, swearing not to
smoke any more. It was he also who said to those who
came in contact with Marie Antoinette: 'Whatever
you do, don't say anything to her about her children'."</p>

<p>For her trial the Queen was taken to the Tribunal
sitting in what is now the First Circle Chamber of the
Palais de Justice, and led back in the evening to her
cell. She was condemned to death on the fifteenth, and
that night wrote a letter to her sister-in-law Elizabeth
which we shall see in the Archives Nationales: it is
firmly written.</p>

<span class="s2">(Louvre)</span></p></div>

<p>The Conciergerie had many other prisoners, but none
so illustrious. Robespierre occupied for twenty-four
hours the little cell adjoining that of the Queen, now
the vestry of the chapel. Madame Du Barry and
Madame Récamier had cells adjacent to that of Madame
Roland. Later Maréchal Ney was imprisoned here.
The oldest part of all&mdash;the kitchens of Saint Louis&mdash;are
not shown.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<p>The Pont au Change, the bridge which connects the
Place du Châtelet with the Boulevard du Palais, the
main street of the Ile de la Cité, was once (as the Ponte
Vecchio at Florence still is) the headquarters of goldsmiths
and small bankers. Not the least of the losses
that civilisation and rebuilders have brought upon us
is the disappearance of the shops and houses from the
bridges. Old London Bridge&mdash;how one regrets that!</p>

<p>At the corner of the Conciergerie is the Horloge that
gives the Quai its name&mdash;a floridly decorated clock which
by no means conveys the impression that it has kept
time for over five hundred years and is the oldest exposed
time-piece in France. Paris, by the way, is very
poor in public clocks, and those that she has are not
too trustworthy. The one over the Gare St. Lazare
has perhaps the best reputation; but time in Paris is
not of any great importance. For most Parisians there
is an inner clock which strikes with perfect regularity at
about twelve and seven, and no other hours really
matter. And yet a certain show of marking time is
made in the hotels, where every room has an elaborate
ormolu clock, usually under a glass case and rarely
going. And in one hotel I remember a large clock on
every landing, of which I passed three on my way upstairs;
and their testimony was so various that it was
two hours later by each, so that by the time I had
reached my room it was nearly time to get up. On asking
the waiter the reason he said it was because they
were synchronised by electricity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<p>There has been a Tour de l'Horloge at this corner
of the Conciergerie ever since it was ordained by Philippe
le Bel in 1299; the present clock, or at least its scheme
of decoration, dates, however, from Henri III.'s reign,
about 1585. The last elaborate restoration was in
1852. In the tower above was a bell that was rung
only on rare occasions. The usual accounts of the
Massacre of St. Bartholomew say that the signal for
that outrage was sounded by the bell of St. Germain
l'Auxerrois; but others give it to the bell of the Tour
de l'Horloge. As they are some distance from each
other, perhaps both were concerned; but since St.
Germain l'Auxerrois is close to the Louvre, where the
King was waiting for the carnage to begin, it is probable
that it rang the first notes.</p>

<p>One of Méryon's most impressive and powerful etchings
represents the Tour de l'Horloge and the façade of the
Conciergerie. It is a typical example of his strange and
gloomy genius, for while it is nothing else in the world
but what it purports to be, it is also quite unlike the
Tour de l'Horloge and the façade of the Conciergerie
as any ordinary eyes have seen them. They are made
terrible and sinister: they have been passed through
the dark crucible of Méryon's mind. To see Paris as
Méryon saw it needs a great effort of imagination, so
swiftly and instinctively do these people remove the
traces of unhappiness or disaster. It is the nature of
Paris to smile and to forget; from any lapse into woe
she recovers with extraordinary rapidity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></p>

<p>Méryon's Paris glowers and shudders; there is blood
on her hands and guilt in her heart. I will not say
that his concept is untrue, because I believe that the
concept formed by a man of genius is always true, although
it may not contain all the truth, and indeed one
has to recall very little history to fall easily into Méryon's
mood; but for the visitor who has chosen Paris for his
holiday&mdash;the typical reader, for example, of this book&mdash;Mr.
Dexter's concept of Paris is a more natural one. (I
wish, by the way, before it is too late, that Mr. Muirhead
Bone would devote some time to the older parts of
the city&mdash;particularly to the Marais. How it lies to
his hand!)</p>

<p>Since we are at the gates of the Palais de Justice let
us spend a little time among the advocates and their
clients in the great hall&mdash;the Salle des Pas Perdus. (In
an interesting work, by the way, on this building, with
a preface by the younger Dumas, the amendment, "La
Salle du temps perdu" is recommended.) The French
law courts, as a whole, are little different from our own:
they have the same stuffiness, they give the same impression
of being divided between the initiated and the
uninitiated, the little secret society of the Bar and the
great innocent world. But the Salle des Pas Perdus is
another thing altogether. There is nothing like that
in the Strand. Our Strand counsel are a dignified,
clean-shaven, be-wigged race, striving to appear old
and inscrutable and important. They are careful of
appearances; they receive instructions only through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
solicitors; they affect to weigh their words; sagacious
reserve is their fetish. Hence our law courts, although
there are many consultations and incessant passings to
and fro, are yet subdued in tone and overawing to the
talkative.</p>

<p>But the Palais de Justice!&mdash;Babel was inaudible
beside it. In the Palais de Justice everyone talks at
once; no one cares a sou for appearances or reticence;
there are no wigs, no shorn lips, no affectation of a
superhuman knowledge of the world. The French
advocate comes into direct communication with his
client&mdash;for the most part here. The movement as well
as the vociferation is incessant, for out of this great hall
open as many doors as there are in a French farce, and
every door is continually swinging. Indeed that is the
chief effect conveyed: that one is watching a farce,
since there has never been a farce yet without a
legal gentleman in his robes and black velvet cap. The
chief difference is that here there are hundreds of them.
As a final touch of humour, or lack of gravity, I may
add that notices forbidding smoking are numerous, and
every advocate and every client is puffing hard at his
cigarette.</p>

<p>Victor Hugo's <i>Notre Dame</i> begins, it will be remembered,
in the great Hall of the Palais de Justice, where
Gringoire's neglected mystery play was performed and
Quasimodo won the prize for ugliness. The Hall, as
Hugo says, was burned in 1618: by a fire which, he
tells us, was made necessary by the presence in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
archives of the Palais of the documents in the case of
the assassination of Henri IV. by Ravaillac. Certain of
Ravaillac's accomplices and instigators wishing these
papers to disappear, the fire followed as a matter of
course, as naturally as in China a house had to be
burned down before there could be roast pig.</p>

<p>Sainte Chapelle, which, with the kitchens of Saint
Louis under the Conciergerie, is all that remains of the
royal period of the Palais de Justice, is, except on
Mondays, always open during the reasonable daylight
hours and is wholly free from vexatious restrictions.
Sanctity having passed from it, the French sightseers
do not even remove their hats, although I have noticed
that the English and Americans still find the habit too
strong. The Chapelle may easily disappoint, for such
is the dimness of its religious light that little is visible
save the dark coloured windows. One is, however,
conscious of perfect proportions and such ecclesiastical
elegance as paint and gold can convey. It is in fact
exquisite, yet not with an exquisiteness of simplicity but
of design and elaboration. It is like a jewel&mdash;almost
a trinket&mdash;which Notre Dame might have once worn
on her breast and tired of. Its flêche is really beautiful;
it darts into the sky with only less assurance and
joy than that of Notre Dame, and I always look up
with pleasure to the angel on the eastern point of the
roof.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="vierge" id="vierge"></a>

<p class="caption">LA VIERGE AUX ROCHERS<br />
<span class="s2">LEONARDO DA VINCI</span><br />
<span class="s2">(<i>Louvre</i>)</span></p></div>

<p>What one has the greatest difficulty in believing is
that Sainte Chapelle is six hundred and fifty years old.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
It was built for the relics brought from the Crusades
by Saint Louis, which are now in the Treasury of Notre
Dame. The Chapel has, of course, known the restorer's
hand, but it is virtually the original structure, and
some of the original glass is still here preserved amid
reconstructions. To me Sainte Chapelle's glass makes
little appeal; but many of my friends talk of nothing
else. Let us thank God for differences of taste. During
the Commune (as recently as 1871) an attempt was
made to burn Sainte Chapelle, together with the Palais
de Justice, but it just failed. That was the third fire
it has survived.</p>

<p>From Sainte Chapelle we pass through the Rue de
Lutèce, which is opposite, across the Boulevard, because
there is a statue here of some interest&mdash;that of Renaudot,
who lived in the first half of the seventeenth
century at No. 8 Quai du Marché Neuf, close by, and
founded in 1631 the first French newspaper, the <i>Gazette
de France</i>. Little could he have foreseen the consequences
of his rash act! It is amusing to stand here
a while and meditate on the torrent that has proceeded
from that small spring. Other cities have as busy a
journalistic life as Paris, and in London the paper boys
are more numerous and insistent, while in London we
have also the contents' bills, which are unknown to
France; and yet Paris seems to me to be more a city
of newspapers than even London is. Perhaps it is the
kiosques that convey the impression.</p>

<p>The London papers and the Paris papers could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
well be more different. In the matter of size, Paris, I
think, has all the advantage, for one may read everything
in a few minutes; but in the matter of ingredients
the advantage surely lies with us, for although English
papers tell far too much, and by their own over-curiousness
foster inquisitiveness and busy-bodydom, yet they
have some sense of what is important, and one can always
find the significant news. In Paris, if one excepts the
best papers, the <i>Temps</i> in particular, the significant
news is elusive. What one will find, however, is a
short story or a literary essay written with distinction,
an anecdote of the day by no means adapted for the
young person, and a number of trumpery tragedies of
passion or excess, minutely told; and in the <i>Figaro</i>
once or twice a week an excellent humorous or satirical
drawing. The signed articles are always good, and
when critical usually fearless, but the unsigned notices
of a new play or spectacle credit it with perfection in
every detail; and here, at any rate, as in our best reviews
of books, we are in a position to feel some of the
satisfaction that proceeds from conscious superiority.</p>

<p>But, it has to be remembered, in Paris people go to the
theatre automatically, whereas we pick and choose and
have our reasons, and even talk of one play being moral
and another immoral, and therefore in Paris an honest
criticism of a play is of little importance. The Paris
<i>Daily Mail</i> seems to have fallen into line very naturally,
for I find in it, on the morning on which I write these
lines, a puff of the Capucines revue, saying that it kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
the house in continuous laughter by its innocent fun, and
will doubtless draw all Paris. As if (i) the laughter in
any Paris theatre was ever continuous, and as if (ii)
there was ever any innocent fun at the Capucines, and as
if (iii) all Paris would go near that theatre if there were!</p>

<p>One reason, I imagine, for the diffuseness of the
English paper and the brevity of the French, is that
the English have so little natural conversation that
they find it useful to acquire news on which to base
more; while the French need no such assistance. The
English again are interested in other nations, whereas
the French care nothing for any land but France.
There is no space in which to continue this not untempting
analysis: it would require much room, for
to understand thoroughly the difference between, say, the
<i>Daily Telegraph</i> and the <i>Journal</i> is to understand the
difference between England and France.</p>

<p>The French comic papers one sees everywhere&mdash;except
in people's hands. I suppose they are bought, or
they would not be published; but I have hardly ever
observed a Frenchman reading one that was his own
property. The fault of the French comic paper is
monotony. Voltaire accused the English of having
seventy religions and only one sauce; my quarrel with
the French is that they have seventy sauces and only
one joke. This joke you meet everywhere. Artists
of diabolical cleverness illustrate it in colours every
week; versifiers and musicians introduce it into songs;
comic singers sing it; playwrights dramatise it; novelists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
and journalists weave it into prose. It is the
oldest joke and it is ever new. Nothing can prevent a
Parisian laughing at it as if it were as fresh as his roll,
his journal or his petit Gervais. For a people with a
world-wide reputation for wit, this is very strange; but
in some directions the French are incorrigibly juvenile,
almost infantine. Personally I envy them for it. I
think it must be charming never to grow out of such
an affection for indecency that even a nursery mishap
can still be always funny.</p>

<p>One of the comic papers must, however, be exempted
from these generalisations. <i>Le Rire</i>, <i>Le Journal Amusant</i>,
<i>La Vie Parisienne</i> and the scores of cheaper imitations
may depend for their living on the one joke; but
<i>L'Assiette au Beurre</i> is more serious. <i>L'Assiette au
Beurre</i> is first and foremost a satirist. It chastises
continually, and its whip is often scorpions. Even its
lighter numbers, chiefly given to ridicule, contain streaks
of savagery.</p>

<p>At the end of the brief Rue de Lutèce is the great
Hôtel Dieu, the oldest hospital in Paris, having been
founded in the seventh century; and to the left of it is
one of the Paris flower markets, where much beautiful
colour may be seen very formally and unintelligently
arranged. Gardens are among those things that we
order (or shall I say disorder?) better than the French
do.</p>

<p>And now we will enter Notre Dame.</p>

Dame from the Quai.</p>

<p>If the Ile de la Cité is the eye of Paris, then, to
adapt one of Oliver Wendell Holmes' metaphors,
Notre Dame is its pupil. It stands on ground that has
been holy, or at least religious, for many centuries, for
part of its site was once occupied by the original mother
church of Paris, St. Etienne, built in the fourth century;
and close by, in the Place du Parvis, have been discovered
the foundations of another church, dating from
the sixth century, dedicated to Sainte Marie; while
beneath that are the remains of a Temple of Apollo or
Jupiter, relics of which we shall see at the Cluny. The
origin of Notre Dame, the fusion of these two churches,
is wrapped in darkness; but Victor Hugo roundly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
states that the first stone of it was laid by Charlemagne
(who reigned from 768 to 814, and whose noble equestrian
statue stands just outside), and the last by Philip
Augustus, who was a friend of our Richard C&oelig;ur de
Lion. The more usual account of the older parts of
the Notre Dame that one sees to-day is that the first
stone of it was laid in 1163, in the reign of Louis VII.,
by Pope Alexander III., who chanced then to be in
Paris engaged in the task of avoiding his enemies, the
Ghibellines, and that in almost exactly a hundred years,
in the reign of Saint Louis, it was completed. (I say
completed, but as a matter of fact it is not completed
even yet, for each of the square towers was designed to
carry a spire, and I remember seeing at the Paris
Exhibition of 1889 a number of drawings of the cathedral
by young architects, with these spires added. It is,
however, very unlikely that they will ever sprout, and
I, for one, hope not.)</p>

<p>Victor Hugo is, of course, if not the first authority
on Notre Dame, its most sympathetic poet, lover and
eulogist; and it seems ridiculous for me to attempt
description when every book shop in Paris has a copy
of his rich and fantastic romance, Book III. of which
is an interlude in the story wholly given to the glory
of the cathedral. You may read there not only of what
Notre Dame is, but of what it is not and should be:
the shortcomings of architects and the vandalism of
mobs are alike reported. Mobs! Paris is seared with
cicatrices from the hands of her matricidal children, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
Notre Dame especially so. Attempts to set her on fire
were made not only by the revolutionaries but by
the Communards too. These she resisted, but much of
her statuary went during the Revolution, the assailants
sparing the Last Judgment on the façade, but accounting
very swiftly for a series of kings of Israel and Judah
(who, however, have since been replaced) under the impression
that they were monarchs of native growth and
therefore not to be endured.</p>

<p>The statue of the Virgin in the centre of the façade,
with Adam and Eve on each side, is not, I may say, the
true Notre Dame of Paris: She is within the church&mdash;much
older and simpler, on a column to the right of
the altar as we face it. She is a sweeter and more
winning figure than that between our first parents on
the façade.</p>

<p>When I first knew Notre Dame it was, to the visitor
from the open air, all scented darkness. And then as
one grew accustomed to the gloom the cathedral opened
slowly like a great flower&mdash;not so beautifully as Chartres,
but with its own grandeur and fascination. That was
twenty years ago. It is not the same since it has been
scraped and lightened within. That old clinging darkness
has gone. There are times of day now, when the
sun spatters on the wall, when it might be almost any
church; but towards evening in the gloom it is Notre
Dame de Paris again, mysterious and a little sinister.
A bright light not only chases the shade from its aisles
and recesses but also shows up the garishness of its glass.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
For the glass of France, usually bad, is here often almost
at its worst. That glorious wheel window in the north
transept&mdash;whose upper wall has indeed more glass than
stone in it&mdash;could not well be more beautiful, and the
rose window over the organ is beautiful too. But for
the rest, the glass is either too pretty, as in the case of
the window over the altar, so lovely in shape, or utterly
trumpery.</p>

<p>The last time I was in Notre Dame I followed a
wedding party through the main and usually locked
door, but although I was the first after the bride and
her father, I was not quick enough to set foot on the
ceremonial carpet, which a prudent verger rolled up
literally upon their heels. It was a fortunate moment
on which to arrive, for it meant a vista of the nave from
the open air right up the central aisle, and that, except
in very hot weather, is rare, and probably very rare
indeed when the altar is fully lighted.</p>

<p>The secret of Notre Dame, both within and without,
is to be divined only by loitering in it with a mind at
rest. To enter intent upon seeing it is useless. Outside,
one can walk round it for ever and still be surprised by
the splendid vagaries, humours and resource of its stone;
while within, one can, by making oneself plastic, gradually
but surely attain to some of the adoration that was
felt for this sanctuary by Quasimodo himself. Let us
sit down on one of these chairs in the gloom and meditate
on some of the scenes which its stones have witnessed.</p>

<p>While it was yet building Raymond VII., Count of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
Toulouse, was scourged before the principal doorway for
heresy, on a spot where the pillory long stood. That
was in 1229. In 1248 St. Louis, on his way to the Holy
Land, visited Notre Dame to receive his pilgrim's staff
and scrip from the Bishop. In 1270 the body of St.
Louis lay in state under this roof before it was carried
to St. Denis for burial. Henry VI. of England was
crowned here as King of France&mdash;the first and last
English king to receive that honour. One Sunday in
1490, while Mass was being celebrated, a man called
Jean l'Anglais (as we should now say, John Bull)
snatched the Host from the priest's hand and profaned
it: for which crime he was burnt. In 1572 Henri IV.
(then Henri of Navarre) was married to Marguerite de
Valois, but being a Protestant he was not allowed within
the church, and the ceremony was therefore performed
just outside. When, however, he entered Paris triumphantly
as a conqueror and a Catholic in 1594, he heard
Mass and assisted at the Te Deum in Notre Dame like
a true Frenchman and ironist. In 1611 his funeral
service was celebrated here.</p>

<p>Some very ugly events are in store for us; let something
pretty intervene. On February 9th, 1779 (in the
narrative of Louise de Grandpré, to whom the study of
Notre Dame has been a veritable passion), a large crowd
pressed towards the cathedral; the ground was strewed
with fresh grass and flowers and leaves; the pillars were
decorated with many coloured banners. In the choir
the vestments of the saints were displayed: the burning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
tapers lit up the interior with a dazzling brightness:
the organ filled the church with joyful harmony, and
the bells rang out with all their might. The whole
court was present, the King himself assisting at the
ceremony, and the galleries were full to overflowing of
ladies of distinction in the gayest of dresses.</p>

<p>Then slowly, through the door of St. Anne, entered
a hundred young girls dressed in white, covered
with long veils and with orange blossom on their heads.
These were the hundred poor girls whom Louis XVI.
had dowered in memory of the birth of Marie-Thérèse-Charlotte
of France, afterwards Duchess of Angoulême,
and it was his wish to assist personally at their wedding
and to seal their marriage licences with his sword, which
was ornamented on the handle or pommel with the
"fleur de lys".</p>

<p>Through the door of the Virgin entered at the same
time one hundred young men, having each a sprig of
orange blossom in his button-hole. The two rows advanced
together with measured steps, preceded by two
Swiss, who struck the pavement heavily with their
halberds. They advanced as far as the chancel rails,
where each young man gave his hand to a young girl,
his fiancée, and marched slowly before the King, bowing
to him and receiving a bow in return. They were then
married by the Archbishop in person.</p>

<p>A very charming incident, don't you think? Such a
royal gift, adds Louise de Grandpré, would be very
welcome to-day, when there are so many girls unmarried,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
for the want of a dot. Every rich young girl who is
married ought to include in her corbeille de noces the
dot of some poor girl. All women, remarks Louise de
Grandpré, have a right to this element of love, which is
sanctified by marriage, honoured by men and blessed
by God. Christian marriage, says Louise de Grandpré,
is a nursery not only of good Catholics but still more
of good citizens. It is much to be wished, she concludes,
that obstacles could be removed, because one deplores
the depopulation of France.</p>

<p>The most fantastic and discreditable episode in the
history of Notre Dame occurred one hundred and fifteen
years ago, when the Convention decreed the Cult of
Reason, and Notre Dame became its Temple. A ballet
dancer was throned on the high altar, Our Lady of
Paris was taken down, and statues of Voltaire and
Rousseau stepped into the niches of the saints. Carlyle
was never more wonderful than in the three or four pages
that describe this cataclysm. He begins with the revolt
of the Curate Parens, followed by Bishop Gobel of Paris
clamouring for an honest calling since there was no
religion but Liberty.</p>

<p>"The French nation," Carlyle writes, "is of gregarious
imitative nature; it needed but a fugle-motion in
this matter; and Goose Gobel, driven by Municipality
and force of circumstances, has given one. What Curé
will be behind him of Boissise; what Bishop behind him
of Paris? Bishop Grégoire, indeed, courageously declines;
to the sound of 'We force no one; let Grégoire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
consult his conscience'; but Protestant and Romish by
the hundred volunteer and assent. From far and near,
all through November into December, till the work is
accomplished, come letters of renegation, come Curates
who 'are learning to be Carpenters,' Curates with their
new-wedded Nuns: has not the day of Reason dawned,
very swiftly, and become noon? From sequestered
Townships come Addresses, stating plainly, though in
Patois dialect, that 'they will have no more to do with
the black animal called Curay, <i>animal noir appelé Curay</i>.'</p>

<p>"Above all things, there come Patriotic Gifts, of
Church-furniture. The remnant of bells, except for
tocsin, descend from their belfries, into the National
melting-pot to make cannon. Censers and all sacred
vessels are beaten broad; of silver, they are fit for the
poverty-stricken Mint; of pewter, let them become
bullets, to shoot the 'enemies <i>du genre humain</i>'. Dalmatics
of plush make breeches for him who had none;
linen albs will clip into shirts for the Defenders of the
Country: old-clothesmen, Jew or Heathen, drive the
briskest trade. Chalier's Ass-Procession, at Lyons, was
but a type of what went on, in those same days, in all
Towns. In all Towns and Townships as quick as the
guillotine may go, so quick goes the axe and the wrench:
sacristies, lutrins, altar-rails are pulled down; the Mass-Books
torn into cartridge-papers: men dance the Carmagnole
all night about the bonfire. All highways
jingle with metallic Priest-tackle, beaten broad; sent to
the Convention, to the poverty-stricken Mint. Good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
Sainte Geneviève's <i>Chasse</i> is let down: alas, to be burst
open, this time, and burnt on the Place de Grève.
Saint Louis's Shirt is burnt;&mdash;might not a Defender of
the Country have had it?...</p>

<p>"For the same day, while this brave Carmagnole-dance
has hardly jigged itself out, there arrive Procureur
Chaumette and Municipals and Departmentals,
and with them the strangest freightage: a New Religion!
Demoiselle Candeille, of the Opera; a woman
fair to look upon, when well rouged; she, borne on
palanquin shoulder-high; with red woollen nightcap;
in azure mantle; garlanded with oak; holding in her
hand the Pike of the Jupiter-<i>Peuple</i>, sails in: heralded
by white young women girt in tricolor. Let the world
consider it! This, O National Convention wonder of
the universe, is our New Divinity; <i>Goddess of Reason</i>,
worthy, and alone worthy of revering. Her henceforth
we adore. Nay were it too much to ask of an august
National Representation that it also went with us to
the <i>ci-devant</i> Cathedral called of Notre-Dame, and
executed a few strophes in worship of her?</p>

<p>"President and Secretaries give Goddess Candeille,
borne at due height round their platform, successively
the Fraternal kiss; whereupon she, by decree, sails to
the right-hand of the President and there alights. And
now, after due pause and flourishes of oratory, the Convention,
gathering its limbs, does get under way in the
required procession towards Notre-Dame;&mdash;Reason, again
in her litter, sitting in the van of them, borne, as one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
judges, by men in the Roman costume; escorted by wind-music,
red nightcaps, and the madness of the world....</p>

<p>"'The corresponding Festival in the Church of Saint-Eustache,'
says Mercier, 'offered the spectacle of a
great tavern. The interior of the choir represented
a landscape decorated with cottages and boskets of
trees. Round the choir stood tables overloaded with
bottles, with sausages, pork-puddings, pastries and
other meats. The guests flowed in and out through
all doors: whosoever presented himself took part of the
good things: children of eight, girls as well as boys,
put hand to plate, in sign of Liberty; they drank also
of the bottles, and their prompt intoxication created
laughter. Reason sat in azure mantle aloft, in a serene
manner; Cannoneers, pipe in mouth, serving her as
acolytes. And out of doors,' continues the exaggerative
man, 'were mad multitudes dancing round the
bonfire of Chapel-balustrades, of Priests' and Canons'
stalls; and the dancers,&mdash;I exaggerate nothing,&mdash;the
dancers nigh bare of breeches, neck and breast naked,
stockings down, went whirling and spinning, like those
Dust-vortexes, forerunners of Tempest and Destruction.'
At Saint-Gervais Church, again, there was a terrible
'smell of herrings'; Section or Municipality having
provided no food, no condiment, but left it to chance.
Other mysteries, seemingly of a Cabiric or even Paphian
character, we leave under the Veil, which appropriately
stretches itself 'along the pillars of the aisles,'&mdash;not to
be lifted aside by the hand of History.</p>

"But there is one thing we should like almost better
to understand than any other: what Reason herself
thought of it, all the while. What articulate words
poor Mrs. Momoro, for example, uttered; when she
had become ungoddessed again, and the Bibliopolist
and she sat quiet at home, at supper? For he was an
earnest man, Bookseller Momoro; and had notions of
Agrarian Law. Mrs. Momoro, it is admitted, made
one of the best Goddesses of Reason; though her teeth
were a little defective.&mdash;And now if the Reader will
represent to himself that such visible Adoration of
Reason went on 'all over the Republic,' through these
November and December weeks, till the Church woodwork
was burnt out, and the business otherwise completed,
he will perhaps feel sufficiently what an adoring
Republic it was, and without reluctance quit this part
of the subject."</p>

<p>I quote in the following pages freely from Carlyle,
because the Revolution is the most important event in
the history of Paris and so horribly recent (you may
still see the traces of Bonaparte's whiff of grape-shot
on the façade of St. Roch), and also because when
there is such an historian to borrow from direct, paraphrase
becomes a crime. None the less, I feel it my
duty to say that the attitude of this self-protective
contemptuous superior Scotchman towards the excitable
French and their hot-headed efforts for freedom
often enrages me as much as his vivid narrative fascinates
and moves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>In 1794, when the New Religion had died down, the
Church became a store for wine confiscated from the
Royalists. In the year following, after the whiff of
grape-shot, the old religion was re-established. A
strange interregnum! How long ago was this?&mdash;only
one hundred and fifteen years&mdash;not four generations.
Could it happen again? Will it?...</p>

<p>These revolutionaries, it may be remarked, were not
the only licentious rioters that Notre Dame had known,
for in its early days it was the scene every year of the
Fête des Fous, an orgy of gluttony and conviviality, in
which, however, one who was a true believer on all other
days might partake.</p>

<p>After these lurid saturnalia it is pleasant again to dip
into the gentle pages of Louise de Grandpré, where,
among other legends of Notre Dame, is the pretty story
of a statue of the Virgin&mdash;now known as the Virgin with
the bird. In the Rue Chanoinesse there lived a young
woman, very devout, who came every day to pray.
She brought with her her son, a little fellow, very
wide-awake and full of spirits: his mother had
taught him to say his prayers. Cyril would close his
little hands to say his "Ave Maria," and he would throw
a kiss to the little Jesus, his dear friend, complaining
sometimes to his mother that the little Jesus would not
play with him. "You are not good enough yet," said
his mother; "Jesus plays only with the little children
in Paradise."</p>

<p>A very severe winter fell and the young mother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
fell ill and no longer came to church. Cyril never saw
the little Jesus now, but he often thought of him as he
played at the foot of his mother's bed. On one of those
days when the sky was dull and leaden and the air
heavy and depressing, and the poor woman was rather
worse and more hopeless than usual, she became so weak
they thought each moment would be her last.</p>

<p>Cyril could not understand why his mother no longer
smiled at him or stroked his hair or called him to her.
With his little heart almost bursting and his eyes full
of tears, he said, "I will go and tell the little Jesus of
my trouble."</p>

<p>While they were attending to the poor mother the
child disappeared. He ran as fast as his little legs
would carry him and entered the cathedral by the
cloister door, crossed the transept, and was soon at the
foot of the statue of the Virgin Mary, where he was
accustomed to say his prayers with his mother. "Little
Jesus," said he, "Thou art very happy, Thou hast Thy
Mother; mine, who was so good, is always asleep now
and I am alone. Little Jesus, wake my mother up, and
I will give you my best toys, morning and evening I
will send you the sweetest kiss and say my best prayer.
And look, to begin with, I have brought you my
favourite bird: he is tame and will eat the golden
crumbs of Paradise out of your hand." At the same
time he stretched out his little closed hand towards
Jesus.</p>

<p>The divine child stretched out His hand and Cyril let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
his beloved little bird escape. The bird, who had a
lovely coloured plumage, flew straight to the hand of
the Infant Christ and has remained there to this day.
The Virgin smiled on the child, and her white stone
robe at that moment became the same colour as the
bird's plumage.</p>

<p>Cyril, with his heart very full, got up to go out, but
before leaving the church turned round to have one
more look at his little bird he loved so dearly: he was
struck with delight and astonishment when he heard
the favoured bird singing one of its sweetest songs in
honour of the Virgin and her Child.</p>

<p>When Cyril returned to his home he went into his
mother's room without making the least noise to see if
she was still asleep. The young mother was sitting upright
in her bed, her head, still very bad, resting on a
pillow, but her wide-open eyes were looking for her
little one.</p>

<p>"I was quite sure the little Jesus would wake you
up," said Cyril, climbing on to her bed. "I took Him
my bird this morning to take care of for me in the
Garden of Paradise."</p>

<p>Life once more returned to the poor woman and she
kissed her boy.</p>

<p>When you next go to Notre Dame, Louise de
Grandpré adds, be sure to visit the Vierge à l'oiseau,
who always hears the prayers of the little ones.</p>

<p>It was in 1804 that Notre Dame enjoyed one of
its most magnificent moments&mdash;at the coronation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
Napoleon and Josephine Beauharnais. The Duchess
d'Abrantès wrote an account of the ceremony which, in
French, is both picturesque and rapturous. "The pope
was the first to arrive. At the moment of his entering
the cathedral, the clergy intoned Tu es Petrus, and
this solemn chant made a deep impression on all. Pius
the VII. advanced to the end of the cathedral with a
majestic yet humble grace.... The moment when all
eyes were most drawn to the Altar steps was when
Josephine received the crown from the Emperor and
was solemnly consecrated by him Empress of the French.
When it was time for her to take an active part in the
great ceremony, the Empress descended from the throne
and advanced towards the altar, where the Emperor
awaited her....</p>

<p>"I saw," the Duchess continues, "all that I have just
told you, with the eyes of Napoleon. He was radiant
with joy as he watched the Empress advancing towards
him; and when she knelt ... and the tears she could
not restrain fell upon her clasped hands, raised more towards
him than towards God: at this moment, when
Napoleon, or rather Bonaparte, was for her her true
providence, at this instant there was between these two
beings one of those fleeting moments of life, unique,
which fill up the void of years.</p>

<p>"The Emperor invested with perfect grace every
action of the ceremony he had to perform: above all,
at the moment of crowning the Empress. This was to
be done by the Emperor himself, who after receiving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
the little closed crown surmounted by a cross, had to
place it on his own head first, and then place it on the
Empress's head. He did this in such a slow, gracious
and courtly manner that it was noticed by all. But at
the supreme moment of crowning her who was to him
his lucky star, he was almost coquettish, if I may use
the term. He placed the little crown, which surmounted
the diadem of brilliants, on her head, first putting it on,
then taking it off and putting it on again, as if assuring
himself that it should rest lightly and softly on her.</p>

<p>"But Napoleon," the Duchess concludes, "when it
came to his own crown, hastily took it from the Pope's
hands and placed it haughtily on his own head&mdash;a proceeding
which doubtless startled his Holiness."</p>

<p>Ten years pass and we find Louis XVIII. and his
family attending Mass at the same altar. Twenty-six
years later, in 1840, a service was held to commemorate
the restoration of the ashes of the Emperor to French
soil, and in 1853 Napoleon III. and Eugénie de Montijo
were married here, under circumstances of extraordinary
splendour. And then we come to plunder and lawlessness
again. On Good Friday, 1871, while Père Olivier
was preaching, a company of Communards entered and
from thenceforward for a while the cathedral was occupied
by the soldiers. For some labyrinthine reason
the destruction of Notre Dame by fire was decided upon,
and a huge pile of chairs and other material soaked in
petrol was erected (this was only thirty-eight years ago),
and no doubt the building would have been seriously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
injured, if not destroyed, had not the medical students
from the Hôtel Dieu, close by, rushed in and saved it.</p>

<p>Among the preachers of Notre Dame was St. Dominic,
to whom in the pulpit the Virgin appeared, bringing
with her his sermon all to his hand in an effulgent
volume; here also preached Père Hyacinthe, but with
less direct assistance.</p>

<p>That the Treasury is an object of interest to English-speaking
visitors is proved by the notice at the door:
"The Persons who desire to visit the Trésor are kindly
requested to wait the guide here for a few minutes,
himself charged of the visit"; but I see no good reason
why any one should enter it. Those, however, that do
will see vessels of gold, much paraphernalia of ecclesiastical
pride and pomp, and certain holy relics. The
crown of thorns is here, given to St. Louis by the King
of Constantinople and carried to Notre Dame, on the
18th of August, 1239, by the barefoot king. Here
also are pieces of the Cross, for the protection of which
St. Louis built Sainte Chapelle, the relics afterwards
being transferred to Notre Dame; and here is a nail
from the Cross&mdash;one of the nails of which even an
otherwise sceptical Catholic can be sure, because it was
given to Charlemagne by Constantine. Charlemagne
gave it to Aix la Chapelle, Charles the Bold brought
it from Aix to St. Denis, and from St. Denis it came
to Notre Dame, where it is enclosed in a crystal case.</p>

<p>The menace of 397 spiral steps in a narrow, dark and
almost airless turret, is no light matter, but it is essential
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
to see Paris from the summit of Notre Dame. That
view is the key to the city, and the traveller who means
to study this city as it deserves, penetrating into the
past as industriously and joyously as into the present,
must begin here. He will see it all beneath him and
around him in its varying ages, and he will be able to
proceed methodically and intelligently. Immediately
below is the Parvis, the scene of the interrupted execution
of Esmeralda, and it was from one of the galleries
below that Quasimodo slung himself down to her rescue.
Here, where we are now standing, she must often have
stood, looking for her faithless Ph&oelig;bus. Only one of
the bells that Quasimodo rang is still in the tower.</p>

<p>Hugo draws attention to the shape of the island, like
that of a ship moored to the mainland by various
bridges, and he suggests that the ship on the Paris
scutcheon (the ship that is to be seen in the design of
the lamps around the Opera) is derived from this resemblance.
It may be so. On each side of us, north
and south, are the oldest parts of Paris that still stand;
in the north the Marais, behind the Tour Saint-Jacques,
and in the south the district between the Rue de Bièvre
and the Boulevard St. Michel. On the south side of
the river lived the students, clerics and professors&mdash;Dante
himself among them, in this very Rue de Bièvre, as
we shall see; while in the Marais, as we shall also see,
dwelt the nobility. West of St. Eustache in the Middle
Ages was nothing but waste ground and woodland, a
kind of Bois, at the edge of which, where the Louvre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
now spreads itself, was a royal hunting lodge, the germ
of the present vast palace.</p>

<p>When the Marais passed out of favour, the aristocracy
crossed the river to the St. Germain quarter, which
clusters around the twin spires of St. Clotilde that now
rise in the south-west. And then the Rue Saint-Honoré
and the Grands Boulevards were built, and so the city
grew and changed until the two culminating touches
were put to it: by M. Eiffel, who built the tower,
and M. Abadie, architect of the beautiful and unreal
Basilique du Sacré-Coeur that crowns the heights of
Montmartre.</p>

<p>The chief eminences that one sees are, near at hand,
the needle-spire of Sainte Chapelle, in the north the
grey mass of St. Eustache, the Châtelet Theatre (advertising
at this moment "Les Pilules du Diable" in
enormous letters), the long roofs of the Halles, and the
outline of the medieval Tour Saint-Jacques. Farther
west the bulky Opera; then, right in front, the Trocadéro's
twin towers, with Mont Valérien looming up
immediately between them; and so round to the south&mdash;to
the Invalides and St. Clotilde, the Panthéon and
the heights of Geneviève.  A wonderful panorama.</p>

<p>Of all the views of Paris I think that from Notre
Dame is the most interesting, because the point is most
central; but the views from Montmartre, from the
Tour Saint-Jacques, the Panthéon and the Arc de
Triomphe should be studied too. The Eiffel Tower has
dwarfed all those eminences; they lie far below it, mere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
ant-hills in the landscape, although they seem high
enough when one essays their steps; yet, although it
makes them so lowly, these older coigns of vantage
should not for a moment be considered as superseded,
for each does for its immediate vicinage what the
Eiffel giant can never do. From the Arc de Triomphe,
for example, you command all the luxurious activity
of the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne and the wonderful
prospect of the Champs Elysées, ending with the Louvre;
and from the Panthéon you may examine the roofs of
the Latin Quarter and see the children at play in the
gardens of the Luxembourg.</p>

<p>The merit of the Eiffel Tower is that he shows you
not only Paris to the ultimate edges in every direction
save on the northern slopes of Montmartre, but he shows
you (almost) France too. How long the Eiffel Tower
is to stand I cannot say, but I for one shall feel sorry
and bereft when he ceases to straddle over Paris. For
though he is vulgar he is great, and he has come to be
a symbol. When he goes, he will make a strange rent
in the sky. This year (1909) is his twentieth: he and
I first came to Paris at the same time; but his life is
serene to-day compared with what it was in his infancy.
At that time his platforms were congested from morn
to dusk; but few visitors now ascend even to the first
stage and hardly any to the top. No visitor, however,
who wants to synthesise Paris should omit this adventure.
Only in a balloon can one get a better view, but
in no balloon adrift from this green earth would I, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
one, ever trust myself, although I must confess that the
procession of those aerial monsters that floated serenely
past the Eiffel Tower on the last occasion that I climbed
it, suggested nothing but content and security. They
rose one by one from the bosky depths of the Bois,
five miles away, gradually disentangled themselves from
the surrounding verdure, assumed their independent
buoyant rotundity and came straight to my waiting
eye. In an hour I counted fifteen, and by the
time the last was free of the earth the first was
away over Vincennes, with the afternoon sun turning
its mud-coloured silk to burnished gold. Paris has
always one balloon floating above her, but fifteen is
exceptional.</p>

<p>Notre Dame remains, however, the most important
height to scale, for Notre Dame is interesting in every
particular, it is soaked in history and mystery. Notre
Dame is alone in the possession of its devils&mdash;those
strange stone fantasies that Méryon discovered. Although
every effort is made to familiarise us with them&mdash;although
they sit docilely as paper-weights on our
tables&mdash;nothing can lessen the monstrous diablerie
of these figures, which look down on Paris with such
greed and cruelty, cunning and cynicism. The best
known, the most saturnine, of all, who leans on the
parapet exactly by the door at the head of the steps,
fixes his inhuman gaze on the dome of the Invalides.
Is it to be wondered at that he wears that expression?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<p>A small family dwells in a room just behind this
chimera, subsisting by the sale of picture-postcards. It
is a strange abode, and an imaginative child would have
a good start in life there. To him at any rate the
demons no doubt would soon lose their terrors and
become as friendly as the heavenly host that are posed
so radiantly and confidently on the ascent to the flèche&mdash;perhaps
even more so. But to the stranger they
must remain cruel and horrible, creating a sense of
disquietude and alarm that it is surely the business of
a cathedral to allay. Curious anomaly! Let us descend.</p>

<p>Before leaving the Ile de la Cité, the Rue Chanoinesse,
to the north of Notre Dame, leading out of the Rue
d'Arcole (near a blackguard pottery shop), should be
looked at. The cloisters of Notre Dame once extended
to this street and covered the ground between it and the
cathedral. The canons, or chanoines, lived here, and
there are still a few attractive old houses; but the
rebuilder is very busy just now. At No. 10, Fulbert,
the uncle of Héloïse, is said to have lived; at No. 18
was the Tour Dagobert, a fifteenth-century building,
by climbing which one had an excellent view of Notre
Dame, but in the past year it has been demolished and
business premises cover its site. At No. 26 are (or
were) the ruins of the twelfth-century chapel of St.
Aignan, where the faithful, evicted from Notre Dame
by the Reign of Reason, celebrated Mass in secret.
Saint Bernard has preached here. The adjacent streets&mdash;the
Rue de Colombe, Rue Massillon, Rue des Ursins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
and Rue du Cloître-Notre-Dame&mdash;have also very old
houses.</p>

<span class="s2"><i>(Louvre)</i></span></p></div>

<p>For the best view of the exterior of Notre Dame one
must take the Quai de l'Archevêché, from which all
its intricacies of masonry may be studied&mdash;its buttresses
solid and flying, its dependences, its massive bulk, its
grace and strength.</p>

ST. LOUIS AND HIS ISLAND</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>
<p class="blockquot">
The Morgue&mdash;The Ile St. Louis&mdash;Old Residents&mdash;St. Louis, the
King&mdash;The Golden Legend&mdash;Religious Intolerance&mdash;Posthumous
Miracles&mdash;Statue of Barye&mdash;The Quai des Célestins.
</p>

<p>On the way from Notre Dame to the Ile St. Louis
we pass a small official-looking building at the
extreme east end of the Ile de la Cité. It is the
Morgue.</p>

<p>But the Morgue is now closed to idle gazers, and you
win your way to a sight of that melancholy slab with
the weary bodies on it and the little jet of water playing
on each, only by the extreme course of having missed
a relation whom you suspected of designs upon his own
life or whom you imagine has been the victim of foul
play. No doubt the authorities were well advised (as
French municipal authorities nearly always are) in closing
the Morgue; but I think I regret it. The impulse
to drift into that low and sinister building behind Notre
Dame was partly morbid, no doubt; but the ordinary
man sees not only too little death, but is too seldom in
the presence of such failure as for the most part governs
here: so that the opportunity it gave was good.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p>I still recall very vividly, in spite of all the millions
of living faces that should, one feels, have blurred one's
prosperous vision, several of the dead faces that lay behind
the glass of this forlorn side-show of the great
entertainment which we call Paris. An old man with a
white imperial; more than one woman of that dreadful
middle-age which the Seine has so often terminated; a
young man who had been stabbed.... Well, the
Morgue is closed to the public now, and very likely no
one who reads this book will ever enter it.</p>

<p>The Ile St. Louis, to put it bluntly, is just as commonplace
as the Ile de la Cité is imposing. It has a monotony
very rare in the older parts of Paris: it is all white
houses that have become dingy: houses that once were
attractive and wealthy and are now squalid. One of the
largest of the old palaces is to-day a garage; there is
not a single house now occupied by the kind of tenant
for which it was intended. Such declensions are always
rather melancholy, even when&mdash;as, for example, at Villeneuve,
near Avignon&mdash;there is the beauty of decay too.
But on the Ile St. Louis there is no beauty: it belongs
to a dull period of architecture and is now duller for its
dirt. Standing on the Quai d'Orléans, however, one
catches Notre Dame against the evening sky, across the
river, as nowhere else, and it is necessary to seek the Ile
if only to appreciate the fitness of the Morgue's position.</p>

<p>The island was first called L'Ile Notre Dame, and was
uninhabited until 1614. It was then developed and
joined to the Ile de la Cité and the mainland by bridges.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
The chief street is the Rue St. Louis, at No. 3 in which
lived Fénélon. The church of St. Louis is interesting
for a relic of the unfortunate Louise de la Vallière. At
No. 17 on the Quai d'Anjou is the Hôtel Lauzun, which
the city of Paris has now acquired, and in which once
lived together for a while the authors of <i>Mademoiselle de
Maupin</i> and <i>Les Fleurs de Mal</i>.</p>

<p>Of Saint Louis, or Louis IX., who gives his name to
this island, and whose hand is so visible in the Ile de la
Cité, it is right to know something, for he was the father
of Paris. Louis was born in 1215, the year of Magna
Charta, and succeeded to the throne while still a boy.
The early years of his reign were restless by reason of
civil strife and war with England, in which he was victor
(at Tailleburg, at Saintes and at Blaize), and then came
his departure for the Holy Land, with 40,000 men, in
fulfilment of a vow made rashly on a sick-bed. The
King was blessed at Notre Dame, as we have seen, and
departed in 1248, leaving his mother Blanche de Castile
as regent. But the Crusade was a failure, and he was
glad to return (with only the ghost of his army) and to
settle down for the first time seriously to the cares of
his throne.</p>

<p>He was a good if prejudiced king: he built wisely
and well, not only Sainte Chapelle, as we have seen, but
the Sorbonne; he devised useful statutes; he established
police in Paris; and, more perhaps than all, he made
Frenchmen very proud of France. So much for his administrative
virtues. When we come to his saintliness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
I would stand aside, for is he not in <i>The Golden Legend</i>?
Listen to William Caxton: "He forced himself to
serve his spirit by diverse castigation or chastising, he
used the hair many times next his flesh, and when he
left it for cause of over feebleness of his body, at the
instance of his own confessor, he ordained the said confessor
to give to the poor folk, as for recompensation of
every day that he failed of it, forty shillings. He fasted
always the Friday, and namely in time of lent and advent
he abstained him in those days from all manner of
fish and from fruits, and continually travailed and pained
his body by watchings, orisons, and other secret abstinences
and disciplines. Humility, beauty of all virtues,
replenished so strong in him, that the more better he
waxed, so, as David, the more he showed himself meek
and humble, and more foul he reputed him before God.</p>

<p>"For he was accustomed on every Saturday to wash
with his own hands, in a secret place, the feet of some
poor folk, and after dried them with a fair towel, and
kissed much humbly and semblably their hands, distributing
or dealing to every one of them a certain sum of
silver, also to seven score poor men which daily came to
his court, he administered meat and drink with his own
hands, and were fed abundantly on the vigils solemn.
And on some certain days in the year to two hundred
poor, before that he ate or drank, he with his own hands
administered and served them both of meat and drink.
He ever had, both at his dinner and supper, three ancient
poor, which ate nigh to him, to whom he charitably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
sent of such meats as were brought before him, and
sometimes the dishes and meats that the poor of our
Lord had touched with their hands, and special the sops
of which he fain ate, made their remnant or relief to be
brought before him, to the end that he should eat it;
and yet again to honour and worship the name of our
Lord on the poor folk, he was not ashamed to eat their
relief."</p>

<p>Qualities have their defects, and such a frame of mind
as that can lead, for all the good motive, to injustice
and even cruelty. Christ's lesson of the Roman coin
is forgotten as quickly as any. Louis' passion for
holiness, which became a kind of self-indulgence, led
him into a hard and ugly intolerance and acts of severe
oppression against those whom he styled heretics. His
short way with the Jews recalled indeed those of our
own King John, who was very nearly his contemporary.
I know not if he pulled out their teeth, but he once
did what must have been as bad, if not worse, for he
published an ordinance "for the good of his soul," remitting
to his Christian subjects the third of their
debts to the Jews; and he also expressed it as his
opinion that "a layman ought not to dispute with an
unbeliever, but strike him with a good sword across the
body," the most practical expression of muscular sectarianism
that I know. Louis' religious fanaticism was,
however, his end; for he was so ill-advised as to undertake
a new Crusade against the unbelievers of Morocco,
and there, while laying siege to Tunis, he died of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
plague. That was in 1270, when he was only fifty-five.</p>

<p>Twenty-seven years later Pope Boniface the Eighth
raised him to the Calendar of Saints, his day being
August 25th. But according to <i>The Golden Legend</i>,
which I for one implicitly believe (how can one help it,
written as it is?), the posthumous miracles of Louis did
not wait for Rome. They began at once. "On that
day that S. Louis was buried," we there read, "a woman
of the diocese of Sens recovered her sight, which she had
lost and saw nothing, by the merits and prayers of the
said debonair and meedful king. Not long after, a young
child of Burgundy both dumb and deaf of kind, coming
with others to the sepulchre or grave of the saint,
beseeching him of help, kneeling as he saw that the
others did, and after a little while that he thus kneeled
were his ears opened and heard, and his tongue redressed
and spake well. In the same year a woman blind was
led to the said sepulchre, and by the merits of the saint
recovered her sight. Also that same year two men and
five women, beseeching S. Louis of help, recovered the
use of going, which they had lost by divers sickness and
languors.</p>

<p>"In the year that S. Louis was put or written in the
catalogue of the holy confessors, many miracles worthy
to be prized befell in divers parts of the world at the
invocation of him, by his merits and by his prayers.
Another time at Evreux a child fell under the wheel of
a water-mill. Great multitude of people came thither,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
and supposing to have kept him from drowning, invoked
God, our Lady and his saints to help the said child, but
our Lord willing his saint to be enhanced among so
great multitude of people, was there heard a voice saying
that the said child, named John, should be vowed
unto S. Louis. He then, taken out of the water, was
by his mother borne to the grave of the saint, and after
her prayer done to S. Louis, her son began to sigh and
was raised on life."</p>

<p>We leave the island by the Pont Sully, first looking
at the statue of Barye, the sculptor of Barbizon, many
of whose best small bronzes are in the Louvre (to say
nothing of the shops of the dealers in the Rue Laffitte)
and several of his large groups in the public gardens of
Paris, one, for example, being near the Orangery in the
Tuileries. Barye's monument standing here at the east
end of the Ile St. Louis balances Henri IV. at the west
end of the Ile de la Cité.</p>

<p>Crossing to the mainland we ought to look at the
old houses on the Quai des Célestins, particularly the
old Hôtel de la Valette, now the Collège Massillon, into
whose courtyard one should boldly peep. At No. 32
we touch very interesting history, for here stood, two
and a half centuries ago, Molière's Illustre Théâtre,
the stage entrance to which may be seen at 15 Rue de
l'Ave Marie.</p>

<p>And now for the Marais.</p>

<h2 class="p6"><a name="chapter_v" id="chapter_v"></a>CHAPTER V<br />
THE MARAIS</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>
<p class="blockquot">
A £32,000,000 Rebuilding Scheme&mdash;Romance and Intrigue&mdash;The
Temple&mdash;The Archives&mdash;Illustrious Handwriting&mdash;The "Uncle"
of Paris&mdash;The Wall of Philip Augustus&mdash;Old Palaces now
Rookeries&mdash;The Carnavalet&mdash;The Perfect Museum&mdash;Latude&mdash;Napoleon&mdash;Madame
de Sévigné&mdash;Chained Streets&mdash;John Law&mdash;The
Rue St. Martin.
</p>

<p>The Marais is that district of old streets and palaces
which is bounded on the south by the Rue
St. Antoine, on the east by the Rue du Turenne, on
the west by the Rue du Temple, and fades away in the
north somewhere below the Rue de Bretagne. The
Rue des Francs Bourgeois is its central highway east
and west.</p>

<p>It was my original intention to devote a large proportion
of this book to this fascinating area&mdash;to describe
it minutely street by street&mdash;and I have notes for that
purpose which would fill half the volume alone. But
the publication of the £32,000,000 scheme for renovating
this and other of the older parts of Paris (one of
the principal points in which is the isolation of the
Musée Carnavalet, which is the heart of the Marais),
coming just at that time, acted like a douche of iced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
water, and I abandoned the project. Instead therefore
I merely say enough (I hope) to impress on every reader
the desirability, the necessity, of hastening to the Rue
des Francs Bourgeois and its dependencies, and refer
them to the two French writers whom I have found
most useful in my own researches&mdash;the Marquis de
Rochegude, author of a <i>Guide Pratique à travers le
Vieux Paris</i> (Hachette) and the Vicomte de Villebresme,
author of <i>Ce que reste du Vieux Paris</i> (Flammarion).
To these I would add M. Georges Cain, the director of
the Carnavalet, to whom I refer later.</p>

<p>No matter where one enters the Marais, it offers the
same alluring prospect of narrow streets and high and
ancient houses, once the abode of the nobility and
aristocracy, but now rookeries and factories&mdash;and, over
all, that sense of thorough insanitation which so often
accompanies architectural charm in France and Italy,
and which seems to matter so little to Latin people.
Hence the additional wickedness of destroying this
district. The Municipality, however, having acquired
superfine foreign notions as to public health, will doubtless
have its way.</p>

<p>Wherever one enters the Marais one finds the traces
of splendour, intrigue and romance; howsoever modern
conditions may have robbed them of their glory, to walk
in these streets is, for any one with any imagination, to
recreate Dumas. For the most part one must make
one's own researches, but here and there a tablet may
be found, such as that over the entrance to a narrow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
and sinister passage at No. 38 Rue des Francs Bourgeois,
which reads thus: "Dans ce passage en sortant de
l'hôtel Barbette le Duc Louis d'Orléans frère du Roi
Charles VI. fut assassiné par Jean Sans Peur, Duc de
Bourgogne, dans la nuit du 23 ou 24 Novembre, 1407".
Five hundred years ago! That gives an idea of the
antiseptic properties of the air of Paris. The Duke of
Orléans, I might remark here, was symmetrically avenged,
for his son assassinated Jean Sans Peur on the bridge
of Montereau all in due course.</p>

<p>The Marais was at its prime from the middle of the
fifteenth century to the beginning of the eighteenth;
at which period the Faubourg St. Antoine was abandoned
by fashion for the Faubourg St. Germain, as we shall
see when the time comes to wander in the Rue de
Varenne and the Rue de Grenelle on the other side of
the river.</p>

<p>Let us enter the Marais by the Rue du Temple at
the Square du Temple, a little south of the Place de la
République. One must make a beginning somewhere.
The Temple, which has now disappeared, was the head-quarters
of the Knight Templars of France before their
suppression in 1307: it then became the property of
the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, who held it until
the Revolution, when all property seems to have changed
hands. Rousseau found sanctuary here in 1765; and
here Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette were imprisoned
for a while in 1792. More tragic by far, it was here
that the little Dauphin died. Napoleon pulled down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
the Tower: Louis XVIII. on his accession awarded the
property to the Princesse de Condé, and Louis-Philippe,
on his, took it back again.</p>

<p>The Rue du Temple has many interesting old houses
and associations. Just north of the Square is the
church of Elizabeth of Hungary, the first stone of
which was laid in 1628 by a less sainted monarch,
Marie de Médicis. It is worth entering to see its
carved wood scenes from Scripture history. At 193
once lived Madame du Barry; at 153 was, in the reign
of Louis XV., the barreau des vinaigrettes&mdash;the vinaigrette
being the forerunner of the cab, a kind of sedan
chair and jinrickshaw; at 62 died Anne de Montmorency,
Constable of France, in the Hôtel de Montmorency.</p>

<span class="s2"><i>(Louvre)</i></span></p></div>

<p>From the Square du Temple we may also walk down
the Rue des Archives, parallel with the Rue du Temple
on the east. This street now extends to the Rue de
Rivoli. It is rich in old palaces, some with very beautiful
relics of their grandeur still in existence, such as the
staircase at No. 78. The fountain at the corner of the
Rue des Haudriettes dates only from 1705. At No.
58 is the gateway, restored, of the old palace of the
Constable de Clisson, built in 1371. Later it belonged
to the Guise family and then to the Soubise. The
Revolution made it the property of the State, and
Napoleon directed that the Archives should be preserved
here. The entrance is in the Rue des Francs
Bourgeois, across the green court; but do not go on a
cold day, because there is no heating process, owing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
the age of the building and the extraordinary value of
the collections. The rooms in themselves are of some
interest for their Louis XV. decoration and mural
paintings, but one goes of course primarily to see the
handwriting of the great. Here is the Edict of Nantes
signed by Henri IV.; a quittance signed by Diana
de Poictiers, very boldly; a letter to Parliament from
Louis XI., in his atrocious hand; a codicil added by
Saint Louis to his will on board a vessel on the coast
of Sardinia, exquisitely written. The scriveners have
rather gone off than improved since those days; look at
the "Registre des enquêteurs royaux en Normandie,"
1248, for a work of delicate minuteness. Marie
Thérèse, wife of Louis XIV., wrote an attractive hand,
but Louis XIV.'s own signature is dull. Voltaire is
discovered to have written very like Swinburne.</p>

<p>Relics of the Revolution abound. Here is Marie
Antoinette's last letter to the Princess Elizabeth,
written the night before she was executed; a letter
of Pétion, bidding his wife farewell, and of Barbaroux
to his mother, both stained with tears. Here also is
the journal of Louis XVI., 1766-1792, and the order
for his inhumation (as Louis Capet), 21st January, 1793.
His will is here too; and so is Napoleon's. I say no
more because the collection is so vast, and also because
a franc buys a most admirable catalogue, with facsimiles,
beginning with the monogram of Charlemagne
himself.</p>

<p>On leaving the Archives we may take an easterly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
course along the Rue des Francs Bourgeois, with the
idea of making eventually for the Carnavalet; but it is
well to loiter, for this is the very heart of the Marais.
One's feet will always be straying down byways that
call for closer notice, and it is very likely that the
Carnavalet will not be reached till to-morrow after all.
Indeed, let "Hasta mañana" be your Marais motto.</p>

<p>One of the first buildings that one notices is the
Mont de Piété, the chief of the Paris pawnbroking
establishments. I am told that the system is an admirable
one; but my own experience is against this
opinion, for I was unable on a day of unexpected stress
at the end of 1907 to effect an entrance at the very
reasonable hour of a quarter past five. The closing of
the English pawnbrokers at seven&mdash;the very moment
at which the ordinary man's financial troubles begin&mdash;is
sufficiently uncivilised; but to cease to lend money
on excellent gold watches at five o'clock in the afternoon
(with the bank closed on the morrow, too, being
New Year's Day) is a scandal. My adventures in search
of relief among French tradesmen who had been at my
feet as recently as yesterday, before supplies had broken
down, I shall never forget, nor shall I relate them here.
This aims at being an agreeable book.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that one of the entrances to
the Mont de Piété is reserved for clients who wish to
raise money on deeds, and I have seen cabmen very busy
in bringing to it people who quite shamelessly hold their
papers in their hands. And why on earth not? And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
yet your English pawner seldom reaches the Three
Brass Balls with such publicity or by any other medium
than his poor feet. Our Mont de Piété for the respectable
is the solicitor's office. A trace of the wall, and one
of its towers, built around Paris by Philip Augustus
in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, may be seen in
the courtyard of the Mont de Piété; but the wall is
better observed in the Rue des Guillemites, at No. 14.</p>

<p>All about here once stood a large convent of the
Blancs-Manteaux, or Servants of the Virgin Mary,
an order which came into being in Florence in the
thirteenth century and of whom the doctor Benazzi
was the general. After the Blancs-Manteaux came
the Hermits of St. Guillaume, or Guillemites, and
later the Benedictines took it over. Next the Mont de
Piété at the back is the church of the Blancs-Manteaux
in its modern form. It is plain and unattractive, but
it wears an air of some purpose, and one feels that it
is much used in this very popular and not too happy
quarter. Just opposite, in a doorway, I watched an
old chiffonnière playing with a grey rabbit. Every inch
of this neighbourhood offers priceless material to the
hand of Mr. Muirhead Bone.</p>

<p>One of the old tavern signs of Paris is to be seen
close by, at the corner of the Rue des Blancs-Manteaux
and the Rue des Archives: a soldier standing by a
cannon, representing l'homme armé. It is a comfortable
little retreat and should be encouraged for such
antiquarian piety.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>The pretty turret at the corner of the Rue des
Francs Bourgeois and the Rue Vieille du Temple
marks the site of the hôtel of Jean de la Balue. Turning
to the left up the Rue Vieille du Temple we come
at No. 87 to a very beautiful ancient mansion, with a
spacious courtyard, built in 1712 for the Cardinal de
Rohan. It is now the national printing works: hence
the statue of Gutenberg in the midst. Visitors are
allowed to see the house itself once a week, but I have
not done so. You will probably not be interfered with
if you just step to the inside of the second courtyard to
see the bas-relief of the steeds of Apollo. Nos. 102 to
108 in the same street mark the remains of another
fine eighteenth-century hôtel. There is also a house
which one should see in the lower part of the street,
on the south side of the Francs Bourgeois&mdash;No. 47,
where by penetrating boldly one comes to a perfect
little courtyard with some beautiful carvings in it, and,
above, a green garden, tended, when I was there, by a
Little Sister of the Poor. The principal courtyard has
a very interesting bas-relief of Romulus and Remus at
their usual meal, and also an old sundial. This palace
was built in 1638.</p>

<p>Returning to the Rue des Francs Bourgeois, we find
at No. 38 the little impasse already referred to, where
the Duc d'Orléans was assassinated. At No. 30 is a
very impressive red-brick palace with a courtyard, now
a nest of offices and factories, once the hôtel of Jean de
Fourcy. A bust of Henri IV. has a place there. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
No. 25 on the other side (seen better from the Rue
Pavée) is an even more splendid abode&mdash;now also cut
up into a rookery&mdash;the Hôtel de Lamoignon, once
Hôtel d'Angoulême, built for Diane, Duchess of Angoulême,
daughter of Henri II.: hence the symbols of
the chase in the ornamentation. The hotel passed to
President de Lamoignon in 1655.</p>

<p>And here is the Carnavalet&mdash;the spacious building,
with a garden and modern additions, on the left&mdash;once
the Hôtel des Ligneries, afterwards the Hôtel de Kernevenoy,
afterwards the Hôtel de Sévigné, and now the
museum of the city of Paris. The only way to understand
Paris is to make repeated visits to this treasure-house.
You will find new entertainment and instruction
every time, because every time you will carry thither
impressions of new objects of interest whose past you
will want to explore. For in the Carnavalet every
phase of the life of the city, from the days of the
Romans and the Merovingians to our own, is illustrated
in one way or another. The pictures of streets alone
are inexhaustible: the streets that one knows to-day
as they were yesterday and the day before yesterday
and hundreds of years ago; the streets one has just
walked through on the way here, in their stages of
evolution: such, for example, as the picture of the
wooden Pont des Meuniers in 1380 with the Tour Saint-Jacques
behind it; the streets with dramas of the
Revolution in progress, such as the picture of the emblems
of Royalty being burned before the statue of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
Liberty (where the Luxor column now stands) in the
Place de la Concorde on August 10th, 1793; such as
the picture of the famous "serment" being taken in
the court of the Jeu de Paume on June 20th, 1789;
such as the picture of the funeral of Marat. For the
perfection of topographical drawing look at the series
by F. Hoffbauer. But it is impossible and needless to
particularise. The visitor with a topographical or
historical bent will find himself in a paradise and will
return and return. One visit is ridiculous.</p>

<p>The catalogue, I may say, is not good, therein falling
into line with the sculpture catalogue at the Louvre.
Everything may be in it, but the arrangement is poor.
In such a museum every article and every picture should
of course have a description attached, if only for the
benefit of the poor visitor, the humblest citizen of Paris
whose museum it is.</p>

<p>There are a few works of art here too, as well as
topographical drawings. Georges Michel, for example,
who looked on landscape much as Méryon looked on
architecture and preferred a threatening sky to a sunny
one, has a prospect from the Plaine St. Denis. Vollon
paints the Moulin de la Galette on Montmartre as it
was in 1865; Troyon spreads out St. Cloud. Here
also are a charming portrait by Chardin of his second
wife; the well-known picture of David's Life School;
drawings by Watteau; an adorable unsigned "Marchand
de Lingerie"; an enchanting leg on a blue
pillow by Boucher; a portrait by Prud'hon of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
unknown man, very striking; and some exquisite work
by Louis Boilly.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="portrait" id="portrait"></a>

<p class="caption">PORTRAIT DE JEUNE HOMME<br />
<span class="s2">ATTRIBUTED TO BIGIO</span><br />
<span class="s2"><i>(Louvre)</i></span></p></div>

<p>The Musée is strong in Henri IV. and the later Louis,
but it is of course in relics of the Revolution and
Napoleon that the interest centres. A casquette of
Liberty; the handle of Marat's bathroom; a portrait
of "La Veuve Capet" in the Conciergerie, in the room
that we have seen; a painted life-mask of Voltaire,
very horrible, and the armchair in which he died; a
copy of the constitution of 1793 bound in the skin
of a man; Marat's snuff-box; Madame Roland as
a sweet and happy child,&mdash;these I remember in particular.</p>

<p>Latude is, however, the popular figure&mdash;Latude the
prisoner of the Bastille who escaped by means of implements
which he made secretly and which are now
preserved here, near a portrait of the enfranchised
gentleman, robust, portly and triumphant, pointing
with one hand to his late prison while the other grasps
the rope ladder. Latude's history is an odd one. He
was born in 1725, the natural son of a poor girl: after
accompanying the army in Languedoc as a surgeon, or
surgeon's assistant, he reached Paris in 1748 and proceeded
to starve. In despair he hit upon an ingenious
trick, which wanted nothing but success to have made
him. He prepared an infernal machine of infinitesimal
aptitude&mdash;a contrivance of practically harmless but
perhaps somewhat alarming explosives&mdash;and this he
sent anonymously to the Marquise de Pompadour, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
then immediately after waited upon her in person at Versailles
to say that he had overheard some men plotting
to destroy her by means of this kind of a bomb, and he
had come post-haste to warn her and save her life. It
was a good story, but Latude seems to have lacked some
necessary gifts as an impostor, for his own share was
detected and he was thrown into the Bastille on the 1st
of May, 1749. A few weeks later he was transferred to
the prison at Vincennes, from which he escaped in 1750.
A month later he was retaken and again placed in the
Bastille, from which he escaped six years later. He got
away to Holland, but was quickly recaptured; and
then again he escaped, after nine more years. He was
then treated as a lunatic and put into confinement at
Charenton, but was discharged in 1777. His liberty,
however, seems to have been of little use to him, and he
rapidly qualified for gaol again by breaking into a
house and threatening its owner, a woman, with a
pistol, and he was imprisoned once more. Altogether
he was under lock and key for the greater part of
thirty-five years; but once he was free in 1784 he kept
his head, and not only remained free but became a
popular hero, and did not a little, by reason of a
heightened account of his sufferings under despotic
prison rule, to inflame the revolutionaries. These
memoirs, by the way, in the preparation of which he
was assisted by an advocate named Thiery, were for the
most part untruthful, and not least so in those passages
in which Latude described his own innocence and ideals.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
Our own canonised prison-breaker, Jack Sheppard, was
a better hero than this man.</p>

<p>The little room devoted to Napoleon is filled with an
intimate melancholy. Many personal relics are here&mdash;even
to a toothbrush dipped in a red powder. His
nécessaires de campagne so compactly arranged illustrate
the minute orderliness of his mind, and the workmanship
of the travelling cases that hold them proves once again
his thoroughness and taste. Everything had to be
right. One of his maps of la campagne de Prusse
is here; others we shall see at the Invalides.</p>

<p>The relics of Madame de Sévigné, who once lived in
this beautiful house, are not very numerous; but they
exercise their spell. Her salon is very much as she left
it, except that the private staircase has disappeared and
a china closet takes its place. Within these walls have
La Rochefoucauld and Bossuet conversed; here she sat,
pen in hand, writing her immortal letters. "Lisons
tout Madame de Sévigné" was the advice of Sainte-Beuve,
while her most illustrious English admirer,
Edward FitzGerald, often quotes her. He came to her
late, not till 1875, but she never loosened her hold. "I
have this Summer," he wrote to Mrs. W. H. Thompson,
"made the Acquaintance of a great Lady, with whom
I have become perfectly intimate, through her Letters,
Madame de Sévigné. I had hitherto kept aloof from
her, because of that eternal Daughter of hers; but 'it's
all Truth and Daylight,' as Kitty Clive said of Mrs.
Siddons. Her Letters from Brittany are best of all, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
those from Paris, for she loved the Country, dear
Creature; and now I want to go and visit her 'Rochers,'
but never shall." "I sometimes lament," he says (to
Mrs. Cowell), "I did not know her before; but perhaps
such an acquaintance comes in best to cheer one toward
the end." With these pleasant praises in our ears let
us leave the Carnavalet.</p>

<p>The Rue de Sévigné itself has many interesting houses,
notably on the south side of the Rue des Francs Bourgeois;
No. 11, for example, was once a theatre, built by
Beaumarchais in 1790. That is nothing; the interesting
thing is that he built it of material from the destroyed
Bastille and the destroyed church of St. Paul.
The fire station close by was once the Hôtel de Perron
de Quincy. It was in this street, on the day of the Fête
Dieu in 1392, that the Constable de Clisson, whose house
we saw in the Rue des Archives, was attacked by Pierre
de Craon.</p>

<p>The Rue des Francs Bourgeois is the highway of the
Marais, and the Carnavalet is its greatest possession;
but, as I have said, the Marais is inexhaustible in architectural
and historical riches. We may work our way
through it, back to the Rue du Temple by any of these
ancient streets; all will repay. The Rue du Temple
extends to the Rue de Rivoli, striking it just by the
Hôtel de Ville, but the lower portion, south of the Rue
Rambuteau, is not so interesting as the upper. There
is, however, to the west of it, just north of the Rue de
Rivoli, a system of old streets hardly less picturesque
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
(and sometimes even more so) than the Marais proper,
in the centre of which is the church of St. Merry, with
one of the most wonderful west fronts anywhere&mdash;a
mass of rich and eccentric decoration. The Saint himself
was Abbot of Autun. He came to Paris in the
seventh century to visit the shrines of St. Denis and St.
Germain. At that time the district which we are now
traversing was chiefly forest, in which the kings of
France would hunt, leaving their palace in the Ile de la
Cité and crossing the river to this wild district&mdash;wild
though so near. St. Merry established himself in his
simple way near a little chapel in the woods, dedicated
to St. Peter, that stood on this spot, and there he died.
After his death his tomb in the chapel performed such
miracles that St. Peter was forgotten and St. Merry was
exalted, and when the time came to rebuild, St. Merry
ousted St. Peter altogether.</p>

<p class="caption">THE ARC DE TRIOMPHE DE L&#39;ETOILE<br />
<span class="s2">(APPROACHING FROM THE AVENUE DU BOIS DE BOULOGNE)</span></p>
</div>
<p>St. Merry's florid west front is in the Rue St. Martin,
once the Roman road from Paris to the north and to
England, and by the Rue St. Martin we may leave this
district; but between it and the Rue du Temple there
is much to see&mdash;such as, for example, the Rue Verrerie,
south of St. Merry's, the head-quarters of the ancient
glassworkers; the Rue Brisemiche, quite one of the best
of the old narrow Paris streets, with iron staples and
hooks still in the walls at Nos. 20, 23, 26 and 29, to
which chains could be fastened so as to turn a street into
an impasse during times of stress and thus be sure of
your man; the Rue Taillepin, also leading out of the Rue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
du Cloître St. Merry into the Rue St. Merri, which has
some fine old houses of its own, notably No. 36 and the
quaint Impasse du B&oelig;uf at No. 10.</p>

<p>Parallel with the Rue St. Merry farther north is
the Rue de Venise, which the Vicomte de Villebresme
boldly calls the most picturesque in old Paris. Now a
very low quarter, it was once literally the Lombard
Street of Paris, the chief abode of Lombardy moneylenders,
while the long and beautiful Rue Quincampoix,
into which it runs on the west, was also a financial
centre, containing no less an establishment than the
famous Banque of John Law, the Scotchman who for
a while early in the eighteenth century controlled French
finance. When Law had matured his Mississippi scheme,
he made the Rue Quincampoix his head-quarters, and
houses in it, we read, that had been let for £40 a year
now yielded £800 a month. In the winter of 1719-20
Paris was filled with speculators besieging Law's offices
for shares. But by May the crash had come and Law
had to fly. Many a house in the Rue Quincampoix,
which is now sufficiently innocent of high finance, dates
from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. There is a
fine doorway at No. 34.</p>

<p>We may regain the Rue St. Martin, just to the east,
by the Rue des Lombards, which brings us to the flamboyant
front of St. Merry's once more. The Rue St.
Martin, which confesses its Roman origin in its straightness,
is still busy with traffic, but neither itself nor the
Rue St. Denis, two or three hundred yards to the west,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
is one-tenth as busy as it was before the Boulevard
Sebastopol was cut between them to do all the real work.
It is a fine thoroughfare and no doubt of the highest
use, but what beautiful narrow streets of old houses it
must have destroyed! We may note in the Rue St.
Martin the pretty fountain at No. 122, and the curious
old house at No. 164, and leave it at the church of St.
Nicholas-des-Champs, no longer in the fields any more
than London's St. Martin's is.</p>

<p>And now after so many houses let us see some
pictures!</p>

THE LOUVRE: I. THE OLD MASTERS</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>
<p class="blockquot">
The Winged Victory of Samothrace&mdash;Botticelli's Fresco&mdash;Luini&mdash;Ingres&mdash;The
Salon Carré&mdash;La Joconde&mdash;Leonardo da Vinci&mdash;Pater,
Lowell and Vasari&mdash;Early Collectors&mdash;Paul Veronese&mdash;Copyists&mdash;The
Salle des Primitifs&mdash;The Grande Galerie&mdash;Landor's
Pictorial Creed&mdash;The Great Schools&mdash;Rembrandt&mdash;Van Dyck
and Rubens&mdash;Amazing Abundance&mdash;The Dutch Masters&mdash;The
Drawings.</p>

<p>It is on the first landing of the Escalier Daru, at the
end of the Galerie Denon, that one of the most
priceless treasures of the Louvre&mdash;one of the most
splendid things in the world&mdash;is to be found: it has
been before us all the way along the Galerie Denon,
that avenue of noble bronzes, the first thing that caught
the eye: I mean the "Winged Victory of Samothrace".
Every one has seen photographs or models of this
majestic and exquisite figure, but it must be studied
here if one is to form a true estimate of the magical
mastery of the sculptor. The Victory is headless and
armless and much mutilated; but that matters little.
She stands on the prow of a trireme, and for every one
who sees her with any imagination must for all time be
the symbol of triumphant and splendid onset. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
figure no doubt weighs more than a ton&mdash;and is as light
as air. The "Meteor" in a strong breeze with all her
sails set and her prow foaming through the waves does
not convey a more exciting idea of commanding and
buoyant progress. But that comparison wholly omits
the element of conquest&mdash;for this is essential Victory as
well.</p>

<p>The statue dates from the fourth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> It
was not discovered until 1863, in Samothrace. Paris is
fortunate indeed to possess not only the Venus of Milo
but this wonder of art&mdash;both in the same building.</p>

<p>Before entering the picture galleries proper, let us
look at two other exceedingly beautiful things also on
this staircase&mdash;the two frescoes from the Villa Lemmi,
but particularly No. 1297 on the left of the entrance
to Gallery XVI., which represents Giovanna Tornabuoni
and the Cardinal Virtues, and is by Sandro Filipepi, whom
we call Botticelli. For this exquisite work alone would
I willingly cross the Channel even in a gale, such is its
charm. A reproduction of it will be found <a href="#giovanna">opposite
page 20</a>, but it gives no impression of the soft delicacy
of colouring: its gentle pinks and greens and purples,
its kindly reds and chestnut browns. One should make
a point of looking at these frescoes whenever one is on
the staircase, which will be often.</p>

<p>The ordinary entrance to the picture galleries of the
Louvre is through the photographic vestibule on the
right of the Winged Victory as you face it, leading to
the Salle Duchâtel, notable for such differing works as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
frescoes by Luini and two pictures by Ingres&mdash;representing
the beginning and end of his long and austere
career. The Luinis are delightful&mdash;very gay and, as
always with this tender master, sweet&mdash;especially "The
Nativity," which is reproduced <a href="#nativity">opposite page 16</a>. The
Ingres' (which were bequeathed by the Comtesse Duchâtel
after whom the room is named) are the "&OElig;dipus solving
the riddle of the Sphinx," dated 1808, when the
painter was twenty-eight, and the "Spring," which
some consider his masterpiece, painted in 1856. He
lived to be eighty-six. English people have so few
opportunities of seeing the work of this master (we have
in oils only a little doubtful portrait of Malibran,
very recently acquired, which hangs in the National
Gallery) that he comes as a totally new craftsman to
most of us; and his severity may not always please.
But as a draughtsman he almost takes the breath
away, and no one should miss the pencil heads, particularly
a little saucy lady, from his hand in the His
de la Salle collection of drawings in another part of
the Louvre.</p>

<p>In the Salle Duchâtel is also a screen of drawings
with a very beautiful head by Botticelli in it&mdash;No. 48.
From the rooms we then pass to the Salon Carré (so
called because it is square, and not, as I heard one
American explaining to another, after the celebrated
collector Carré who had left these pictures to the nation),
and this is, I suppose, for its size, the most valuable
gallery in the world. It is doubtful if any other combination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
of collections, each contributing of its choicest,
could compile as remarkable a room, for the "Monna
Lisa," or "La Joconde," Leonardo da Vinci's portrait of
the wife of his friend Francesco del Giocondo, which is
its greatest glory and perhaps the greatest glory of all
Paris too, would necessarily be missing.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="winged" id="winged"></a>
<img src="images/i_120.jpg" width="474" height="650" alt="THE WINGED VICTORY OF SAMOTHRACE" />
<p class="caption">THE WINGED VICTORY OF SAMOTHRACE<br />
<span class="s2"><i>(Louvre)</i></span></p></div>

<p>Paris without this picture would not be the Paris
that we know, or the Paris that has been since 1793
when "La Joconde" first became the nation's property&mdash;ever
more to smile her inscrutable smile and exert her
quiet mysterious sway, not only for kings and courtiers
but for all. When all is said, it is Leonardo who gives
the Louvre its special distinction as a picture gallery.
Without him it would still be magnificent: with him
it is priceless and sublime. For not only are there the
"Monna Lisa" and (also in the Salon Carré) the sweet
and beautiful "Madonna and Saint Anne," but in the
next, the Grande Galerie, are his "Virgin of the Rocks,"
a variant of the only Leonardo in our National Gallery,
and the "Bacchus" (so like the "John the Baptist") and
the "John the Baptist" (so like the "Bacchus") and the
portrait of the demure yet mischievous Italian lady who
is supposed to be Lucrezia Crivelli, and who (in spite of
the yellowing ravages of time) once seen is never forgotten.</p>

<p>The Louvre has all these (together with many
drawings), but above all it has the Monna Lisa, of which
what shall I say? I feel that I can say nothing. But
here are two descriptions of the picture, or rather two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
descriptions of the emotions produced by the picture
on two very different minds. These I may quote as
expressing, between them, all. I will begin with that
of Walter Pater: "As we have seen him using incidents
of sacred story, not for their own sake, or as mere subjects
for pictorial realisation, but as a cryptic language
for fancies all his own, so now he found a vent for his
thought in taking one of these languid women, and raising
her, as Leda or Pomona, as Modesty or Vanity, to
the seventh heaven of symbolical expression.</p>

<p>"<i>La Gioconda</i> is, in the truest sense, Leonardo's
masterpiece, the revealing instance of his mode of
thought and work. In suggestiveness, only the <i>Melancholia</i>
of Dürer is comparable to it; and no crude
symbolism disturbs the effect of its subdued and graceful
mystery. We all know the face and hands of the
figure, set in its marble chair, in that circle of fantastic
rocks, as in some faint light under sea. Perhaps of all
ancient pictures time has chilled it least.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> As often
happens with works in which invention seems to reach
its limit, there is an element in it given to, not invented
by, the master. In that inestimable folio of drawings,
once in the possession of Vasari, were certain designs by
Verrocchio, faces of such impressive beauty that Leonardo
in his boyhood copied them many times. It is hard not
to connect with these designs of the elder, by-past
master, as with its germinal principle, the unfathomable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
smile, always with a touch of something sinister on it,
which plays over all Leonardo's work. Besides, the
picture is a portrait. From childhood we see this image
defining itself on the fabric of his dreams; and but for
express historical testimony, we might fancy that this
was but his ideal lady, embodied and beheld at last.
What was the relationship of a living Florentine to this
creature of his thought? By what strange affinities
had the dream and the person grown up thus apart,
and yet so closely together? Present from the first
incorporeally in Leonardo's brain, dimly traced in the
designs of Verrocchio, she is found present at last in <i>Il
Giocondo's</i> house. That there is much of mere portraiture
in the picture is attested by the legend that
by artificial means, the presence of mimes and flute-players,
that subtle expression was protracted on the
face. Again, was it in four years and by renewed labour
never really completed, or in four months and as by
stroke of magic, that the image was projected?</p>

<p>"The presence that rose thus so strangely beside the
waters, is expressive of what in the ways of a thousand
years men had come to desire. Hers is the head upon
which all 'the ends of the world are come,' and the
eyelids are a little weary. It is a beauty wrought out
from within upon the flesh, the deposit, little cell by
cell, of strange thoughts and fantastic reveries and exquisite
passions. Set it for a moment beside one of
those white Greek Goddesses or beautiful women of
antiquity, and how would they be troubled by this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
beauty, into which the soul with all its maladies has
passed! All the thoughts and experience of the world
have etched and moulded there, in that which they have
of power to refine and make expressive the outward
form, the animalism of Greece, the lust of Rome, the
mysticism of the middle age with its spiritual ambition
and imaginative loves, the return of the Pagan world,
the sins of the Borgias. She is older than the rocks
among which she sits; like the vampire, she has been
dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave;
and has been a diver in deep seas, and keeps their fallen
day about her; and trafficked for strange webs with
Eastern merchants; and, as Leda, was the mother of
Helen of Troy, and, as Saint Anne, the mother of Mary;
and all this has been to her but as the sound of lyres
and flutes, and lives only in the delicacy with which it
has moulded the changing lineaments, and tinged the
eyelids and the hands. The fancy of a perpetual life,
sweeping together ten thousand experiences, is an old
one; and modern philosophy has conceived the idea
of humanity as wrought upon by, and summing up in
itself, all modes of thought and life. Certainly Lady
Lisa might stand as the embodiment of the old fancy,
the symbol of the modern idea."</p>

<p>This was what the picture meant for Pater; whether
too much, is beside the mark. Pater thought it and
Pater wrote it, and that is enough. To others, who
are not as Pater, it says less, and possibly more. This,
for example, is what "Monna Lisa" suggested to one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
of the most distinguished and civilised minds of our
time&mdash;James Russell Lowell:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">She gave me all that woman can,<br />
Nor her soul's nunnery forego,<br />
A confidence that man to man<br />
Without remorse can never show.</p>

<p class="stanza">Rare art, that can the sense refine<br />
Till not a pulse rebellious stirs,<br />
And, since she never can be mine,<br />
Makes it seem sweeter to be hers!</p></div>

<p>Finally, since we cannot (I believe) spend too much
time upon this picture, let me quote Vasari's account of
it. "For Francesco del Giocondo, Leonardo undertook
to paint the portrait of Monna Lisa, his wife, but, after
loitering over it for four years, he finally left it unfinished.
This work is now in the possession of the
King Francis of France, and is at Fontainebleau.
Whoever shall desire to see how far art can imitate
nature may do so to perfection in this head, wherein
every peculiarity that could be depicted by the utmost
subtlety of the pencil has been faithfully reproduced.
The eyes have the lustrous brightness and moisture
which is seen in life, and around them are those pale,
red, and slightly livid circles, also proper to nature,
with the lashes, which can only be copied, as these are,
with the greatest difficulty; the eyebrows also are represented
with the closest exactitude, where fuller and
where more thinly set, with the separate hairs delineated
as they issue from the skin, every turn being followed,
and all the pores exhibited in a manner that could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
be more natural than it is: the nose, with its beautiful
and delicately roseate nostrils, might be easily believed
to be alive; the mouth, admirable in its outline, has the
lips uniting the rose-tints of their colour with that of
the face, in the utmost perfection, and the carnation of
the cheek does not appear to be painted, but truly of
flesh and blood; he who looks earnestly at the pit of
the throat cannot but believe that he sees the beating
of the pulses, and it may be truly said that this work is
painted in a manner well calculated to make the boldest
master tremble, and astonishes all who behold it, however
well accustomed to the marvels of art.</p>

<p>"Monna Lisa was exceedingly beautiful, and while
Leonardo was painting her portrait, he took the precaution
of keeping some one constantly near her, to sing
or play on instruments, or to jest and otherwise amuse
her, to the end that she might continue cheerful, and
so that her face might not exhibit the melancholy expression
often imparted by painters to the likenesses
they take. In this portrait of Leonardo's, on the
contrary, there is so pleasing an expression, and a smile
so sweet, that while looking at it one thinks it rather
divine than human, and it has ever been esteemed a
wonderful work, since life itself could exhibit no other
appearance."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="joconde" id="joconde"></a>

<p class="caption">LA JOCONDE: MONNA LISA<br />
<span class="s2">LEONARDO DA VINCI</span><br />
<span class="s2"><i>(Louvre)</i></span></p></div>

<p>King Francis I. (who met our Henry VIII. on the
Field of the Cloth of Gold) bought the picture of
Monna Lisa from the artist for a sum of money equal
now to £20,000. It was on a visit to Francis that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
Leonardo died. "Monna Lisa" was the most valuable
picture in the cabinet of Francis I. and was first hung
there in 1545. It is very interesting to think that
this work, the peculiar glory of the Gallery, should also
be its nucleus, so to speak. The Venus of Milo and the
Winged Victory, which I have grouped with "Monna
Lisa" as its chief treasures, were not added until the
last century.</p>

<p>Among other pictures in the Louvre which date
from the inception of a royal collection in the brain of
Francis I. are the "Virgin of the Rocks" by Leonardo,
Raphael's "Sainte Famille" (No. 1498) and "Saint
Michael," Andrea del Sarto's "Charité" and Piombo's
"Visitation". Louis XIII. began his reign with about
fifty pictures and increased them to two hundred, while
under Louis XIV., the Louvre's most conspicuous friend,
the royal collection grew from these two hundred to
two thousand&mdash;assisted greatly by Colbert the financier,
who bought for the Crown not only much of the
collection of the banker Jabach of Cologne, the Pierpont
Morgan of his day, who had acquired the art
treasures of our own Charles I., but also the Mazarin
bibelots. Under Louis XIV. and succeeding monarchs
the pictures oscillated between the Louvre, the Luxembourg
and Versailles. The Revolution centralised them
in the Louvre, and on 8th November, 1793, the collection
was made over to the public. During the first
Republic one hundred thousand francs a year were set
aside for the purchase of pictures.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span></p>

<p>But we are in the Salon Carré. Close beside "La
Joconde" is that Raphael which gives me personally
more pleasure than any of his pictures&mdash;the portrait,
beautiful in greys and blacks, of Count Baldassare
Castiglione, reproduced <a href="#balthasar">opposite page 52</a>; here is a
Correggio (No. 1117) bathed in a glory of light; here
is a golden Giorgione; here is an allegory by Titian
(No. 1589) not so miraculously coloured as the Correggio
but wonderfully rich and beautiful; here is a
little princess by Velasquez; and near it a haunting
portrait of a young man (No. 1644) which has been
attributed to many hands, but rests now as the work of
Francia Bigio. I reproduce it <a href="#portrait">opposite page 70</a>. And
that is but a fraction of the treasures of the Salon Carré.
For there are other Titians, notably the portrait (No.
1592) of a young man with a glove (reproduced <a href="#homme">opposite
page 64</a>) marked by a beautiful gravity; other Raphaels,
more characteristic, including "La Belle Jardinière"
(No. 1496), filled with a rich deep calm; the sweetest
Luini that I remember (No. 1354), and the immense
"Marriage at Cana" by Paolo Veronese, which when
I saw it recently was being laboriously engraved on
copper by a gentleman in the middle of the room. It
was odd to watch so careful a piece of translation in
the actual making&mdash;to see Veronese's vast scene with
its rich colouring and tremendous energy coming down
into spider-like scratches on two square feet of hard
metal. I did not know that such patience was any
longer exercised. This picture, by the way, has a double
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
interest&mdash;the general and the particular. As Whistler
said of Switzerland, you may both admire the mountain
and recognise the tourist on the top. It is full of
portraits. The bride at the end of the table is Eleanor
of Austria; at her side is Francis I. (who found his
way into as many pictures as most men); next to him,
in yellow, is Mary of England. The Sultan Suliman I.
and the Emperor Charles V. are not absent. The
musicians are the artist and his friends&mdash;Paul himself
playing the 'cello, Tintoretto the piccolo, Titian the
bass viol, and Bassano the flute. The lady with a
toothpick is (alas!) Vittoria Colonna.</p>

<p>It is, by the way, always student-day at the Louvre&mdash;at
least I never remember to have been there, except
on Sundays, when copyists were not at work. Many of
the copies are being made to order as altar pieces in
new churches and for other definite purposes. Not all,
however! A newspaper paragraph lying before me
states that the authorities of the Louvre have five
hundred unfinished copies on their hands, abandoned by
their authors so thoroughly as never to be inquired for
again. I am not surprised.</p>

<p>From the Salle Carré we enter the Grande Galerie,
which begins with the Florentine School, and ends, a
vast distance away, with Rembrandt. But first it is
well to turn into the little Salle des Primitifs Italiens,
a few steps on the right, for here are very rare
and beautiful things: Botticelli's "Madonna with a
child and John the Baptist" (No. 1296); Domenico
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
Ghirlandaio's "Portrait of an old man and a boy"
(No. 1322), which I reproduce <a href="#vieux">opposite page 136</a>, that
triumph of early realism, and his "Visitation" (No.
1321), with its joyful colouring, culminating in a glorious
orange gown; Benedetto Ghirlandaio's "Christ on
the way to Golgotha" (No. 1323, on the opposite wall),
a fine hard red picture; two little Piero di Cosimos (on
each side of the door), very mellow and gay&mdash;representing
scenes in the marriage of Thetis and Peleus; Fra
Filippo Lippi's "Madonna and Child with two sainted
abbots" (No. 1344), and the "Nativity" next it (No.
1343); a sweet and lovely "Virgin and Child" (No.
1345) of the Fra Filippo Lippi school; another, also
very beautiful, by Mainardi (No. 1367); a canvas of portraits,
including Giotto and the painter himself, by Paolo
Uccello (No. 1272), the very picture described by Vasari
in the <i>Lives</i>; and Giotto's scenes in the life of St.
Francis, in the frame of which, as we shall see, I once,
for historical comparison, slipped the photograph of M.
Henri Pol, charmeur des oiseaux. These I name; but
much remains that will appeal even more to others.</p>

<p>To walk along the Grande Galerie is practically to
traverse the history of art: Italian, Spanish, British,
German, Flemish and Dutch paintings all hang here.
Nothing is missing but the French, which, however, are
very near at hand. Some lines of Landor which always
come to my mind in a picture gallery I may quote
hereabouts with peculiar fitness, and also with a desire
to transfer the haunting&mdash;a very good one even if one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
does not agree with the reference to Rembrandt, which
I do not:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
First bring me Raphael, who alone hath seen<br />
In all her purity Heaven's Virgin Queen,<br />
Alone hath felt true beauty; bring me then<br />
Titian, ennobler of the noblest men;<br />
And next the sweet Correggio, nor chastise<br />
His little Cupids for those wicked eyes.<br />
I want not Rubens's pink puffy bloom,<br />
Nor Rembrandt's glimmer in a dirty room<br />
With these, nor Poussin's nymph-frequented woods<br />
His templed heights and long-drawn solitudes.<br />
I am content, yet fain would look abroad<br />
On one warm sunset of Ausonian Claude.</p>

<p>It is no province of this book to take the place of
a catalogue; but I must mention a few pictures. The
left wall is throughout, I may say, except in the case
of the British pictures, the better. Here, very early,
is the lovely "Holy Family" of Andrea del Sarto (No.
1515); here hang the four Leonardos which I have
mentioned and certain of his derivatives; a beautiful
Andrea Solario (No. 1530); a Lotto, very modern in
feeling (No. 1350); a very striking "Salome" by Luini
(1355), and the same painter's "Holy Family" (No.
1353); Mantegna; a fine Palma; Bellini; Antonello
da Messina; more Titians, including "The Madonna
with the rabbit" (No. 1578) and "Jupiter and Antiope"
(No. 1587); a new portrait of a man in armour by
Tintoretto, lately lent to the Louvre, one of his gravest
and greatest; and so on to the sweet Umbrians&mdash;to
Perugino and to Raphael, among whose pictures are two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
or three examples of his gay romantic manner, the most
pleasing of which (No. 1509), "Apollo and Marsyas," is
only conjecturally attributed to him.</p>

<p>We pass then to Spain&mdash;to Murillo, who is represented
here both in his rapturous saccharine and his realistic
moods, "La Naissance de la Vierge" (No. 1710) and
"Le Jeune Mendicant" (No. 1717); to Velasquez, who,
however, is no longer credited with the lively sketch of
Spanish gentlemen (No. 1734); and to Zurbaran, the
strong and merciless.</p>

<p>The British pictures are few but choice, including a
very fine Raeburn, and landscapes by Constable and
Bonington, two painters whom the French elevated to
the rank of master and influence while we were still debating
their merits. Such a landscape as "Le Cottage"
(No. 1806) by Constable, with its rich English simplicity,
brings one up with a kind of start in the midst of so
much grandiosity and pomp. It is out of place here,
and yet one is very happy to see it. From Britain we
pass to the Flemish and Germans&mdash;to perfect Holbeins,
including an Erasmus and Dürer; to Rubens, who, however,
comes later in his full force, and to the gross and
juicy Jordaens.</p>

<p>Then sublimity again; for here is Rembrandt of the
Rhine. After Leonardo, Rembrandt is to me the glory
of the Louvre, and especially the glory of the Grande
Galerie, the last section of which is now hung with
twenty-two of his works. Not one of them is perhaps
superlative Rembrandt: there is nothing quite so fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
as the portrait of Elizabeth Bas at the Ryks, or the
"School of Anatomy" at the Mauritshuis, or the "Unjust
Steward" at Hertford House; but how wonderful
they are! Look at the miracle of the flying angel in
the picture of Tobias&mdash;how real it is and how light!
Look closely at the two little pictures of the philosopher
in meditation. I have chosen the beautiful "Venus et
L'Amour" and the "Pèlerins d'Emmaus" for reproduction;
but I might equally have taken others. They
will be found opposite <a href="#venus">pages 146</a> and <a href="#pelerins">154</a>.</p>

<p>On the other wall are a few pictures by Rembrandt's
pupils and colleagues, such as Ferdinand Bol and Govaert
Flinck, who were always on the track of the master;
and more particularly Gerard Dou: note the old woman
in his "Lecture de la Bible," for it is Rembrandt's
mother, and also look carefully at "La Femme Hydropique,"
one of his most miraculously finished works&mdash;a
Rembrandt through the small end of a telescope.</p>

<p>From these we pass to the sumptuous Salle Van Dyck,
which in its turn leads to the Salle Rubens, and one is
again filled with wonder at the productivity of the twain&mdash;pupil
and master. Did he never tire, this Peter Paul
Rubens? Did a new canvas never deter or abash him?
It seems not. No sooner was it set up in his studio than
at it he must have gone like a charge of cavalry, magnificent
in his courage, in his skill and in his brio. What
a record! Has Rubens' square mileage ever been worked
out, I wonder. He was very like a Frenchman: it is
the vigour and spirit of Dumas at work with the brush.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
In the Louvre there are fifty-four attested works, besides
many drawings; and it seems to me that I must have
seen as many in Vienna, and as many in Dresden, and
as many in Berlin, and as many in Antwerp, and as
many in Brussels, to say nothing of the glorious landscape
in Trafalgar Square. He is always overpowering;
but for me the quieter, gentler brushes. None the less
the portrait of Helène Fourment and their two children,
in the Grande Galerie, although far from approaching
that exquisite picture in the Liechtenstein Gallery in
Vienna, when the boys were a little older, is a beautiful
and living thing which one would not willingly miss.</p>

<p>Van Dyck was, of course, more austere, less boisterous
and abundant, but his record is hardly less amazing,
and he seems to have faced life-size equestrian groups,
such as the Charles the First here, without a tremor.
The Charles is superb in his distinction and disdain;
but for me, however, Van Dyck is the painter of single
portraits, of which, no matter where I go, none seems
more noble and satisfying than our own Cornelius Van
Voorst in Trafalgar Square. But the "Dame et sa Fille,"
which is reproduced on the opposite page, is very
beautiful.</p>

<span class="s2">VAN DYCK</span><br />
<span class="s2"><i>(Louvre)</i></span></p></div>

<p>All round the Salle Rubens are arranged the little
cabinets in which the small Dutch pictures hang&mdash;the
Jan Steens and the Terburgs, the Hals' and the Metsus,
the Ruisdaels and the Karel du Jardins, the Ostades
and the golden Poelenburghs. Of these what can I say?
There they are, in their hundreds, the least of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
worth many minutes' scrutiny. But a few may be picked
out: the Jan van Eyck (No. 1986) "La Vierge au
Donateur," reproduced <a href="#donateur">opposite page 166</a>, in which the
Chancellor Rollin reveres the Virgin on the roof of a
tower, and small wild animals happily play around, and
we see in the distance one of those little fairy cities so
dear to the Flemish painter's imagination; David's
"Noce de Cana"; Metsu's "Vierge et Enfant" the
Memling and the Rogier van der Weyden, close by;
Franz Hals' "Bohémienne," reproduced <a href="#hals">opposite page
186</a>; Van der Heyden's lovely "Plaine de Haarlem" (No.
2382); Paul Potter's "Bois de La Haye" (No. 2529),
almost like a Diaz, and his little masterpiece No. 2526;
the Terburgs: the "Music Lesson" (No. 2588) and the
charming "Reading Lesson" (No. 2591) with the little
touzled fair-haired boy in it, reproduced <a href="#lecon">opposite page
206</a>; Ruisdael's "Paysage dit le Coup de Soleil" (No.
2560); Hobbema's "Moulin à eau" (No. 2404); and,
to my eyes, almost first of all, Vermeer of Delft's "Lacemaker"
(No. 2456), reproduced <a href="#dentelliere">opposite page 216</a>.
These are all I name.</p>

<p>So much for the paintings by the masters of the
world. The Louvre also has drawings from the same
hands, which hang in their thousands in a series of
rooms on the first floor, overlooking the Rue de Rivoli.
Here, as I have said, are other Leonardos (look particularly
at No. 389), and here, too, are drawings by Raphael
and Rembrandt, Correggio and Rubens (a child's head
in particular), Domenico Ghirlandaio and Chardin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
Mantegna and Watteau, Dürer and Ingres. I reproduce
only one, a study attributed to the school of
Fabriano, <a href="#head">opposite page 228</a>. Here one may spend
a month in daily visits and wish never to break the
habit. We have in England hardly less valuable and
interesting drawings, but they are not to be seen in this
way. One must visit the Print Room of the British
Museum and ask for them one by one in portfolios.
The Louvre, I think, manages it better.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
The Early French Painters&mdash;Richard Parkes
Bonington&mdash;Chardin&mdash;Historical
Paintings&mdash;Bonington again&mdash;The Moreau Collection&mdash;The
Thomy-Thierret Collection&mdash;The Chauchard Collection.</p>

<p>French pictures early and late now await us. On
our way down the Grande Galerie we passed on
the right two entrances to other rooms. Taking that
one which is nearer the British School, we find ourselves
in Salle IX., leading to Salle X. and so on to Galerie
XVI., which completes the series. In Salle X. the
beginnings of French art may be studied, and in
particular the curious Japanese effects of the Ecole
d'Avignon. Here also is very interesting work by Le
Maître de Moulins and a remarkable series of drawings
in the case in the middle, representing the Siege of Troy.
Salle XI. is notable for its portraits by Clouet and
others; in Salle XII. we find Le Sueur, and in Salle XIII.
the curious brothers Le Nain, of whom there are very
interesting examples at the Ionides collection at South
Kensington, but nothing better than the haymaking
scene here, No. 542.</p>

<p>French painting of the seventeenth century bursts
upon us in the great Salle XIV. or Galerie Mollien,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
of which Nicolas Poussin and Ausonian Claude are the
giants, thus completing Landor's pleasant list with
which we entered the Grande Galerie in the last chapter.
There are wonderful things here, but so crowded are
they that I always feel lost and confused. There is,
however, compensation and relief, for the room also
contains one minute masterpiece which perhaps not
more than five out of every thousand visitors have seen,
and yet which can be studied with perfect quietness
and leisure. This is a tiny water-colour in the revolving
screen in the middle. There is much delicate work in
this screen, dainty aquatint effects by the Dutchmen
Ostade and Van der Heyden, Weenix and Borssom, and
so forth; but finest of all (as so often happens) is a
little richly-coloured drawing of Nottingham by Bonington,
who, as we shall see, has a way of cropping
up unsuspectedly and graciously in this great collection&mdash;and
very rightly, since he owed so much to that
Gallery. He was one of the youngest students ever
admitted, being allowed to copy there at the age of
fifteen, while at the Beaux Arts. That was in the year
after Waterloo. There may in the history of the
Gallery have been copyists equally young, but there can
never have been one more distinguished or who had
deeper influence on French art. Paris not only made
Bonington's career but ended it, for it was while sketching
in its streets ten years or more later that he met
with the sunstroke which brought about his death
when he was only twenty-seven, and stilled the marvellous
hand for ever.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span></p>

<p>Salle XV. is given up to portraits, among them&mdash;and
shall I say chief of them, certainly chief of them in
point of popularity&mdash;the adorable portrait of Madame
Elizabeth Louise Vigée Le Brun and her daughter,
painted by herself, which is perhaps the best-known
French picture, and of which I give a reproduction
<a href="#madame">opposite page 246</a>. On a screen in this room are placed
the latest acquisitions. When last I was there the more
noticeable pictures were a portrait by Romney of himself,
rich and melancholy, recalling to the mind Tennyson's
monologue, and a sweet and ancient religieuse by Memling.
There were also some Corot drawings, not perhaps
so good as those in the Moreau collection, but very
beautiful, and a charming old-world lady by Fragonard.
These probably are by this time distributed over the
galleries, and other new arrivals have taken their place.
I hope so.</p>

<p>Galerie XVI., which leads out of the Salle des Portraits,
brings us to French art of the eighteenth century&mdash;to
Greuze and David, to Fragonard and Watteau,
to Lancret and Boucher, and, to my mind, most charming,
most pleasure-giving of all, to Jean Baptiste Siméon
Chardin, who is to be seen in perfection here and in the
distant room which contains the Collection La Caze.
It is probable that no painter ever had quite so much
charm as this kindly Frenchman, whose loving task it
was to sweeten and refine homely Dutch art. Chardin
is the most winsome of all painters: his brush laid a
bloom on domestic life. The Louvre has twenty-eight
of his canvases, mostly still-life, distributed between the
Salle La Caze and Salle No. XVI., where we now are.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
The most charming of all, which is to be seen in the
Salle La Caze, is reproduced <a href="#benedicite">opposite page 234</a>.</p>

<p>Having walked down the left wall of the Salle, it is
well to slip out at the door at the end for a moment
and refresh oneself with another view of Botticelli's
fresco, which is just outside, before returning by the
other wall, as we have to go back through the Salle
des Portraits in order to examine Salle VIII., a vast
room wholly filled with French paintings of the first
half of the nineteenth century, bringing the nation's
art to the period more or less at which the Luxembourg
takes it up, though there is a certain amount of overlapping.
No room in the Louvre so wants weeding
and re-hanging as this, for it is a sad jumble. Search,
however, for the magnificent examples by the great <i>plein-airistes</i>.
They are lost in this wilderness; but there they
are for those that seek&mdash;the two vast Troyons; Corot's
magic "Souvenir de Castel-Gondolfon"; a great Daubigny,
"Les Vendances de Bourgogne," very hard and fine,
and the same gigantic painter's large and lovely harvest
scene, "Le Moisson"; Rousseau's "Sortie de Forêt," not
unlike the Rousseau in the Wallace Collection in London,
with its natural archway of branches and rich
tenderness of colour; the sublime "La Vague," by
Courbet; lastly Millet's "Les Glaneuses," the three
stooping women in the cornfield who come to the inward
eye almost as readily as the figures in the
"Angelus". The red, blue and yellow of their head-kerchiefs
alone would make this picture worth a millionaire's
ransom.</p>

<p>We leave the room by the door opposite that through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
which we came and find ourselves again in the Grande
Galerie. The way now is to the left, through the
Italian Schools, through the Salon Carré (why not stay
there and let French art go hang?) through the
Galerie d'Apollon (of which more anon), through the
Rotunda and the Salle des Bijoux (whither we shall
return), to another crowded late eighteenth and early
nineteenth century French room chiefly notable for
David's Madame Récamier on her joyless little sofa.
(Why didn't we stay in the Salon Carré?) In this
room also are two large Napoleonic pictures&mdash;one by
Gros representing General Bonaparte visiting the
plague victims at Jaffa in 1799; the other, by David,
of the consecration service in Notre Dame, described in
an earlier chapter. To see this kind of picture, at
which the French have for many years been extremely
apt, one must of course go to Versailles, where the
history of France is spread lavishly over many square
miles of canvas.</p>

<p>From this room&mdash;La Salle des Sept Cheminées&mdash;we
pass through a little vestibule, with Courbet's great
village funeral in it, to the very pleasant Salle La Caze,
containing the greater part of the collection of the late
Dr. La Caze, and notable chiefly for the Chardins of
which I have already spoken, and also, by the further
door, for a haunting "Buste de femme" attributed to
the Milanese School. But there are other admirable
pictures here, including a Velasquez, and it repays
study.</p>

<p>Leaving by the further door and walking for some
distance, we come to the His de la Salle collection of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
drawings, from which we gain the Collection Thiers,
which should perhaps be referred to here, although there
is not the slightest necessity to see it at all. The
Thiers collection, which occupies two rooms, is remarkable
chiefly for its water-colour copies of great paintings.
The first President of the Republic employed
patient artists to make copies suitable for hanging
upon his walls of such inaccessible works as the "Last
Judgment" of Michael Angelo and Raphael's Dresden
Madonna. The results are certainly extraordinary,
even if they are not precisely la guerre. The Arundel
Society perhaps found its inspiration in this collection.
Among the originals there is a fine Terburg.</p>

<p>On leaving the Thiers collection, one comes to a
narrow passage with a little huddle of water-colours,
very badly treated as to light and space, and well worth
more consideration. These pictures should not be
missed, for among them are two Boningtons, a windmill
in a sombre landscape, which I reproduce <a href="#windmill">opposite page
274</a>, and next to it a masterly drawing of the statue
of Bartolommé Colleoni at Venice, which Ruskin called
the finest equestrian group in the world. Bonington,
who had the special gift of painting great pictures in
small compass (just as there are men who can use a
whole wall to paint a little picture on), has made a
drawing in which the original sculptor would have
rejoiced. It would do the Louvre authorities good if
these Boningtons, which they treat so carelessly, were
stolen.  Nothing could be easier; I worked out the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
felony as I stood there. All that one would need would
be a few friends equally concerned to teach the Louvre
a lesson, behind whose broad backs one could ply the
diamond and the knife. Were I a company promoter
this is how I should spend my leisure hours. Such
theft is very nigh virtue.</p>

<p>Among other pictures in these bad little rooms&mdash;Nos.
XVII. and XVIII.&mdash;are some Millets and Decamps.</p>

<p>Three more collections&mdash;and these really more interesting
than anything we saw in Galeries XIV. or XVI., or
the Salle des Sept Cheminées&mdash;await us; but two of them
need considerable powers of perambulation. Chronology
having got us under his thumb we must make the
longer journey first&mdash;to the Collection Moreau. The
Collection Moreau is to be found at the top of the
Musée des Arts Décoratifs, the entrance to which is in
the Rue de Rivoli. In the lower part of this building
are held periodical exhibitions; but the upper parts are
likely at any rate for a long time to remain unchanged,
and here are wonderful collections of furniture, and here
hang the few but select canvases brought together by
Adolphe Moreau and his son, and presented to the nation
by M. Etienne Moreau-Nelaton.</p>

<p>In the Thomy-Thierret collection in another top
storey of the same inexhaustible palace (to which our
fainting feet are bound) are Corots of the late period;
M. Moreau bought the earlier. Here, among nearly
forty others, you may see that portrait of Corot painted
in 1825, just before he left for Rome, which his parents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
exacted from him in return for their consent to his new
career and the abandonment of their rosy dreams of his
success as a draper. Here you may see "Un Moine,"
one of the first pictures he was able to sell&mdash;for five
hundred francs (twenty pounds). Here is the charming
marine "La Rochelle" painted in 1851 and given by
Corot to Desbarolles and by Desbarolles to the younger
Dumas. Here is the very beautiful Pont de Mantes,
reproduced <a href="#pont">opposite page 252</a>, belonging to his later
manner, and here also is an exceptionally merry little
sketch, "Bateau de pêche à marée basse". I mention
these only, since selection is necessary; but everything
that Corot painted becomes in time satisfying to the
student and indispensable to its owner. Among the
pencil drawings we find this exquisite lover of nature
once more, with fifteen studies of his Mistress.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting of the Moreau pictures
is Fantin-Latour's "Hommage à Delacroix," with its
figures of certain of the great and more daring writers
and painters of the day, 1864, the year after Delacroix's
death. They are grouped about his framed portrait&mdash;Manet,
red haired and red bearded, a little like Mr.
Meredith in feature; Whistler, with his white feather
black and vigorous, and his hand on the historical cane;
Legros (the only member of the group who is still living,
and long may he live!) and Baudelaire, for all the world
like an innocent professor. Manet himself is represented
here by his famous "Déjeuner sur l'herbe," which the
scandalised Salon of 1863 refused to hang, and three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
smaller canvases. Among the remaining pictures which
gave me most pleasure are Couture's portrait of Adolphe
Moreau the younger; Daumier's "La République";
Carrière's "L'enfant à la soupière" (notice the white
bowl); Decamps' "La Battue," curiously like a Koninck;
and Troyon's "Le Passage du Gué," so rich and sweet.</p>

<p>From the Collection Moreau, with its early Barbizon
pictures, one ought to pass to the Chauchard
with its middle period, and then to the Collection
Thomy-Thierret; but let us go to the Thomy-Thierret
now. It needs courage and endurance, for the
room which contains these exquisite pictures is only to
be reached on foot after climbing many stairs and walking
for what seem to be many miles among models of
ships and other neglected curiosities on the Louvre's topmost
floor. But once the room is reached one is perfectly
happy, for every picture is a gem and there is no
one there. M. Thomy-Thierret, who died quite recently,
was a collector who liked pictures to be small, to be rich
in colour, and to be painted by the Barbizon and
Romantic Schools. Here you may see twelve Corots,
all of a much later period than those bequeathed by M.
Moreau, among them such masterpieces as "Le Vallon"
(No. 2801), reproduced <a href="#vallon">opposite the next page</a>, "Le
Chemin de Sèvres" (No. 2803), "Entrée de Village" (No.
2808), "Les Chaumières" (No. 2809), and "La Route
d'Arras" (No. 2810). Here are thirteen Daubignys, including
"Les Graves de Villerville" (No. 28,177), and one
sombre and haunting English scene&mdash;"La Tamise à
Erith" (No. 2821). Here are ten Diazes, most beautiful
of which to my eyes is "L'Éplorée" (No. 2863). Here are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
ten Rousseaus, among them "Le Printemps" (No. 2903),
with its rapturous freshness, which I reproduce <a href="#printemps">opposite
page 120</a>, and "Les Chênes" (No. 2900), such a group
of trees as Rousseau alone could paint. Here are six
Millets, my favourite being the "Précaution Maternelle"
(No. 2894), with its lovely blues, which again reappear
in "Le Vanneur" (No. 2893). Here are eleven Troyons,
of which "La Provende des poules" (No. 2907), with its
bustle of turkeys and chickens around the gay peasant
girl beneath a burning sky, reproduced <a href="#provende">opposite page
266</a>, is one of the first pictures to which my feet carry
me on my visits to Paris. Here are twelve Duprés,
most memorable of which is "Les Landes" (No. 2871).
And here also are Delacroix', Isabeys and Meissoniers.</p>

<p>The Chauchard pictures&mdash;140 in number&mdash;which are
now hanging in five rooms leading from the Salle Rubens,
were bequeathed to the nation by M. Alfred Chauchard,
proprietor of the Magasins du Louvre (which some
visitors to Paris have considered the only Louvre).
Among the pictures are twenty-six by Corot, twenty-six
by Meissonier, eight by Millet (including "L'Angelus")
and eight by Daubigny.</p>

<span class="s2">COROT</span><br />
<span class="s2"><i>(Louvre: Thomy-Thierret Collection)</i></span></p></div>

<p>I may say at once that the Chauchard Collection does
not compare with the Thomy-Thierret in courage. M.
Thomy-Thierret liked his pictures to be small and exquisite
and happy. Within the limits imposed the
Barbizon painters never did anything more delightful
or indeed better. The whole collection&mdash;and it is
beyond price&mdash;is homogeneous: it embodies the taste
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
of one man. M. Moreau and his son had a robuster
taste, a bolder eye. They wanted strength as well as
sweetness, or strength alone. Their collection has not
quite the homogeneity of the Thomy-Thierret, but one
feels here also that personality has honestly been at
work bringing together things of beauty and power that
pleased it, and nothing else. But M. Chauchard....</p>

<p>It is perfectly evident in a moment that M. Chauchard
had neither knowledge nor taste. He merely had
acumen. At a certain moment in his successful life, one
feels, M. Chauchard extended himself before the fire-place,
stroked his spreading <i>favoris</i> (so like those of our own
Whiteley), and announced "I must have some pictures".
Other prosperous men saying the same thing have forthwith
taken their courage in their hands and bought
pictures; but M. Chauchard as I see him (both in his
dazzling marble bust and in the portrait by Benjamin Constant),
was not like that. "I must have some pictures,"
he announced, and then quickly reverted to type and
cast about as to the best means of discovering whose
pictures were most worth buying. That is how the
Chauchard Collection came about, if I am not mistaken:
it was the venture of an essentially commercial man&mdash;an
investor-in-grain&mdash;who also desired a reputation of virtuosity
but did not want to lose money over it.</p>

<p>As it happens M. Chauchard was well advised. But
wonderful as they are, beautiful as they are, valuable as
they are, there is not a picture here which suggests to
the visitor that it ever brought a real gladness to the
eyes of its owner in his own home.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>But I can convince you only too easily that M. Chauchard
had no taste. Do you remember when driving out
to Longchamp, through the Bois, either to the Races or
to Suresnes, just after you pass the Cascade, you come
on the left to a windmill overlooking the course, and on
the right to a white villa, all alone and unreal? A club
house, one naturally thinks it, for the French Jockey
Club, or something of that kind. You may have forgotten
the villa, but you will recall it when I say that
on the very trim vivid lawn in front of it, scattered
about, supposed to be counterfeiting life, are various
animals in stone&mdash;a stag, a doe, some dogs, all white and
motionless, in the best mortuary manner, and all, to
you and me, outrageous. Well, that was one of M.
Chauchard's homes. M. Chauchard was the owner of
that lawn and its occupants. The man who looking out
of his window could feast his eye on these triumphs of
the monumental mason was the same man who bought
for his walls sheep by Jacque and Millet, and cattle and
dogs by Troyon....</p>

<p>No matter. M. Chauchard acquired pictures and left
them to the French Nation, and they are now on view
for ever (always excepting the fatal Continental Mondays)
for all to rejoice in. The first really compellingly
beautiful work as one enters&mdash;the first picture to touch
the emotions&mdash;is Rousseau's "La Charrette". It was
painted in 1862, five years before the painter's death,
which left the villagers of Barbizon the richer by a
studio-chapel. It is a mere trifle and it is as wonderful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
as a summer day: a forest glade, in the midst of which
a tiny wagon and white horse with blue trappings are
seen beneath a burning sky, such a picture as ought to
have a wall if not a room to itself: such a picture as I
should like to see placed above an altar. It is the same
subject&mdash;a forest wagon&mdash;that provided what in some
ways is the best or most attractive Corot here. His
"La Charrette" is a large easy landscape lit by the
gracious light of which he alone had the secret. In the
foreground is a deep sandy road with the charrette
labouring through it. But before we came to this we
had stood before one of the finest of the seven Daubignys,
"La Seine à Bezons," a river scene of almost terrible
calm, with Mont Valerien in the distance and geese
and boats on the near shore, and implicit in it the
sincerity, strength and humility of this great man.</p>

<p>At the end of the room hang two large and busy
Troyons, one on each side of M. Chauchard himself, the
donor of the feast, whose bust in the whitest Carrara,
with the whiskers in full fig and the <i>croix de grand
officier du Legion d'honneur</i> meticulously carved upon
it, stands here, as stipulated in the will. These two
Troyons, of which there are eighteen in all, are I think
the largest. One represents cows sauntering lazily down
to drink; the other the return from the market of a
mixed herd of cattle and sheep, with a donkey in
panniers, being driven by a man on a white horse. As
was his wont, Troyon chose a road on the edge of a
cliff with a very green border of turf and an exquisite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
glimpse of sea to the left. None of the new Troyons
perhaps is as fine as those in Salle VIII. of the Louvre
proper, but this is a superb thing. The "Boeufs se
rendant au labour" and the "Le Retour à la ferme" in
Salle VIII. should be visited after the Chauchards.</p>

<p>And so we leave the first and largest room, in the
midst of which are two cases of Barye's bronzes&mdash;lions
and tigers, bears and deer, snakes and birds&mdash;and enter
the first room on the left as we came in; and here we
begin to see for the first time pictures with special knots
of people before them. For the Meissoniers begin here.
And of Meissonier what am I to say? For Meissonier
leaves me cold. He is marvellous; but he leaves me
cold. He painted with a fidelity and spirit that border
on the magical; but those qualities that I want in
a picture, those callings of deep to deep, one seeks
in vain. Hence I say nothing of Meissonier, except
that he was a master, that there are twenty-six of his
masterpieces here, and that the crowd opposite his
"1814" extends to the opposite side. How can one
spend time over "Le cheval de l'ordonnance" and the
"Petit Poste de Grand'-Garde" when Daubigny's "Les
Laveuses (effet de soleil couchant)" hangs so near&mdash;this
great placid green picture, so profoundly true as to
be almost an act of God? Corot's "Etang de Ville
d'Avray" is here too, liquid and tender.</p>

<p>The little room that leads out of this is usually
almost unenterable by reason of the press before Meissonier's
"1814". This undoubtedly is one of the little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
great pictures of the world, and I can understand the
enthusiasm of the French sightseer, whose blood is still
stirrable by the enduring personality of the saturnine
man on the white horse. Neighbouring pictures are a
rich cattle piece by Diaz, immediately over "1814";
Rousseau's "La Mare," which is not a little like the
Koninck in the Ionides Collection at South Kensington,
and the same painter's "La Mare au pied du coteau"
with its lovely middle distance. Here too is one of
Corot's many <i>pêcheurs</i>, who little knew as they fished
on so quietly in the still gentle light that they were
being rendered immortal by the quaint little bourgeois
with the long pipe, sketching on the bank. One of the
finest of the Duprés is also here&mdash;"La Vanne," a deep
green scene of water.</p>

<p>In the last room we come at last to that painter
whose work, next perhaps to Meissonier's, is the magnet
which draws such a steady stream of worshippers to
this new shrine of art&mdash;to Jean François Millet. M.
Chauchard had eight Millets, including the "Angelus,"
but though it is the "Angelus" which is considered of
many to be the very core of this collection, I find more
pleasure in "La Bergère gardant ses moutons" (reproduced
<a href="#bergere">opposite page 308</a>), which I would call, I think,
the best picture of all. It has been remarked that no
picture containing sheep can ever be a bad picture; but
when Millet paints them, and when they are grazing
beneath such a sky, and when one of those grave sweet
peasant women&mdash;a monument of patient acceptance and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
the humility that comes from the soil&mdash;is their shepherdess,
why then it is almost too much; and the brave
ardent Jacque, whose "Moutons au Pâturage" hangs
close by, is half suspected of theatricalism. Millet is so
great, so full of large elemental simplicity and truth
that one regrets that his eight pictures have not a room
to themselves. That they should be elbowed by the
neat dancing-master <i>chefs d'&oelig;uvre</i> of Meissonier is something
of a catastrophe.</p>

<p>Thinking over the collection, I have very strongly the
feeling already expressed that it was wrongly assembled.
The investor rather than the enthusiast is too apparent.
M. Chauchard, it is true, refrained from making money
by his acquisitions, since he gave them to the nation,
and this is eternally to his credit. None the less I find
it difficult to esteem him as perhaps one should even in
the light of a generous testator. One so wants pictures
to be loved. And of all pictures that are lovable and
that long to pass into their owner's being&mdash;to engentle
his eyes and enrich his experience and deepen his nature&mdash;none
equal those that were painted by the little
group of friends who in the middle of the last century
made the white-walled village of Barbizon their head-quarters
and the Forest of Fontainebleau their happy
hunting-ground and a Wordsworthian passion for nature
their creed.</p>

<p>Such pictures deserve the most faithful owners and
the most thoughtful hospitality....</p>

<p>But if we cannot get all as we wish it, at least we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
must be grateful for the next best thing, and to M.
Chauchard and the Louvre authorities we must all be
supremely grateful.</p>

<p>The Louvre is to-day the most wonderful museum in
the world; but what would one not give to be able to
visit it as it was in 1814, when it was in some respects
more wonderful still. For then it was filled with the
spoils of Napoleon's armies, who had instructions always
to bring back from the conquered cities what they could
see that was likely to beautify and enrich France. It
is a reason for war in itself. I would support any war
with Austria, for example, that would bring to London
Count Czernin's Vermeer and the Parmigianino in the
Vienna National Gallery; any war with Germany that
would put the Berlin National Gallery at our disposal.
Napoleon had other things to fight for, but that comprehensive
brain forgot nothing, and as he deposed a
king he remembered a blank space in the Louvre that
lacked a Raphael, an empty niche waiting for its
Phidias. The Revolution decreed the Museum, but it
was Napoleon who made it priceless and glorious. After
the fall of this man a trumpery era of restitution set in.
Many of his noble patriotic thefts were cancelled out.
The world readjusted itself and shrank into its old
pettiness. Priceless pictures and statues were carried
again to Italy and Austria, Napoleon to St. Helena.</p>

THE TUILERIES</h2>

<p>Had we turned our back only thirty-eight years
ago on Frémiet's statue of Joan of Arc (which
was not there then) in the Place de Rivoli, and walked
down what is now the Rue de Tuileries towards the
Seine, we should have had on our left hand a beautiful
and imposing building&mdash;the Palace of the Tuileries,
which united the two wings of the Louvre that now
terminate in the Pavillon de Marsan just by the Place
de Rivoli and the Pavillon de Flore on the Quai des
Tuileries. The palace stretched right across this interval,
thus interrupting the wonderful vista of to-day
from the old Louvre right away to the Arc de Triomphe&mdash;probably
the most extraordinary and beautiful civilised,
or artificial, vista in the world. The palace had,
however, a sufficiently fine if curtailed share of it from
its own windows.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span></p>

<p>All Parisians upwards of forty-five must remember
the Palace perfectly, for it was not destroyed until 1871,
during the Commune, and it was some years after that
incendiary period before all traces were removed and
the gardens spread uninterruptedly from the Carrousel
to the Concorde.</p>

<p>The Palace of the Tuileries (so called because it
occupied a site previously covered by tile kilns) was
begun in 1564 and had therefore lived for three centuries.
Catherine de Médicis planned it, but, as we
shall read later, she lost interest in it very quickly
owing to one of those inconvenient prophecies which
were wont in earlier times so to embarrass rulers, but
which to-day in civilised countries have entirely gone
out. The Tuileries was a happy enough palace, as
palaces go, until the Revolution: it then became for
a while the very centre of rebellion and carnage; for
Louis XVI. and the Royal Family were conveyed
thither after the fatal oath had been sworn in the
Versailles tennis-court. Then came the critical 10th of
August, when the King consented to attend the conference
in the Manège (now no more, but a tablet opposite
the Rue Castiglione marks the spot) and thus lost
everything.</p>

<p>The massacre of the Swiss Guards followed: but here
it is impossible, or at least absurd, not to hear Carlyle.
Mandal, Commander of the National Guard, I would
premise, has been assassinated by the crowd; the Constitutional
Assembly sits in the Manège, and the King,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
a prisoner in the Tuileries, but still a hesitant and an
optimist, is ordered to attend it. At last he consents.
"King Louis sits, his hands leant on his knees, body
bent forward; gazes for a space fixedly on Syndic
R&oelig;derer; then answers, looking over his shoulder to
the Queen: <i>Marchons!</i> They march; King Louis,
Queen, Sister Elizabeth, the two royal children and
governess: these, with Syndic R&oelig;derer, and Officials of
the Department; amid a double rank of National
Guards. The men with blunderbusses, the steady red
Swiss gaze mournfully, reproachfully; but hear only
these words from Syndic R&oelig;derer: 'The King is going
to the Assembly; make way'. It has struck eight, on
all clocks, some minutes ago: the King has left the
Tuileries&mdash;forever.</p>

<p>"O ye stanch Swiss, ye gallant gentlemen in black,
for what a cause are ye to spend and be spent! Look
out from the western windows, ye may see King Louis
placidly hold on his way; the poor little Prince Royal
'sportfully kicking the fallen leaves'. Fremescent
multitude on the Terrace of the Feuillants whirls
parallel to him; one man in it, very noisy, with a long
pole: will they not obstruct the outer Staircase, and
back-entrance of the Salle, when it comes to that?
King's Guards can go no farther than the bottom step
there. Lo, Deputation of Legislators come out; he of
the long pole is stilled by oratory; Assembly's Guards
join themselves to King's Guards, and all may mount
in this case of necessity; the outer Staircase is free, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
passable. See, Royalty ascends; a blue Grenadier lifts
the poor little Prince Royal from the press; Royalty
has entered in. Royalty has vanished for ever from
your eyes.&mdash;And ye? Left standing there, amid the
yawning abysses, and earthquake of Insurrection; without
course; without command: if ye perish, it must
be as more than martyrs, as martyrs who are now without
a cause! The black Courtiers disappear mostly;
through such issues as they can. The poor Swiss know
not how to act: one duty only is clear to them, that of
standing by their post; and they will perform that.</p>

<p>"But the glittering steel tide has arrived; it beats
now against the Château barriers and eastern Courts;
irresistible, loud-surging far and wide;&mdash;breaks in, fills
the Court of the Carrousel, blackbrowed Marseillese
in the van. King Louis gone, say you; over to the
Assembly! Well and good: but till the Assembly
pronounce Forfeiture of him, what boots it? Our
post is in that Château or stronghold of his; there
till then must we continue. Think, ye stanch Swiss,
whether it were good that grim murder began, and
brothers blasted one another in pieces for a stone
edifice?&mdash;Poor Swiss! they know not how to act: from
the southern windows, some fling cartridges, in sign of
brotherhood; on the eastern outer staircase, and within
through long stairs and corridors, they stand firm-ranked,
peaceable and yet refusing to stir. Westermann
speaks to them in Alsatian German; Marseillese plead,
in hot Provençal speech and pantomime; stunning hubbub
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
pleads and threatens, infinite, around. The Swiss
stand fast, peaceable and yet immovable; red granite
pier in that waste-flashing sea of steel.</p>

<p>"Who can help the inevitable issue; Marseillese and
all France on this side; granite Swiss on that? The
pantomime grows hotter and hotter; Marseillese sabres
flourishing by way of action; the Swiss brow also clouding
itself, the Swiss thumb bringing its firelock to the
cock. And hark! high thundering above all the din,
three Marseillese cannon from the Carrousel, pointed by
a gunner of bad aim, come rattling over the roofs! Ye
Swiss, therefore: <i>Fire!</i> The Swiss fire; by volley, by
platoon, in rolling fire: Marseillese men not a few, and
'a tall man that was louder than any,' lie silent, smashed
upon the pavement;&mdash;not a few Marseillese, after the
long dusty march, have made halt <i>here</i>. The Carrousel
is void; the black tide recoiling; 'fugitives rushing as
far as Saint-Antoine before they stop'. The Cannoneers
without linstock have squatted invisible, and left
their cannon; which the Swiss seize....</p>

<p>"Behold, the fire slackens not; nor does the Swiss
rolling-fire slacken from within. Nay they clutched
cannon, as we saw; and now, from the other side, they
clutch three pieces more; alas, cannon without linstock;
nor will the steel-and-flint answer, though they try it.
Had it chanced to answer! Patriot onlookers have
their misgivings; one strangest Patriot onlooker thinks
that the Swiss, had they a commander, would beat.
He is a man not unqualified to judge; the name of him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
Napoleon Buonaparte. And onlookers, and women,
stand gazing, and the witty Dr. Moore of Glasgow
among them, on the other side of the River: cannon
rush rumbling past them; pause on the Pont Royal;
belch out their iron entrails there, against the Tuileries;
and at every new belch, the women and onlookers 'shout
and clap hands'. City of all the Devils! In remote
streets, men are drinking breakfast-coffee; following
their affairs; with a start now and then, as some dull
echo reverberates a note louder. And here? Marseillese
fall wounded; but Barbaroux has surgeons; Barbaroux
is close by, managing, though underhand and under
cover. Marseillese fall death-struck; bequeath their
firelock, specify in which pocket are the cartridges; and
die murmuring, 'Revenge me, Revenge thy country!'
Brest Fédéré Officers, galloping in red coats, are shot as
Swiss. Lo you, the Carrousel has burst into flame!&mdash;Paris
Pandemonium! Nay the poor City, as we said,
is in fever-fit and convulsion: such crisis has lasted for
the space of some half hour.</p>

<p>"But what is this that, with Legislative Insignia,
ventures through the hubbub and death-hail, from the
back-entrance of the Manège? Towards the Tuileries
and Swiss: written Order from his Majesty to cease
firing! O ye hapless Swiss, why was there no order not
to begin it? Gladly would the Swiss cease firing: but
who will bid mad Insurrection cease firing? To Insurrection
you cannot speak; neither can it, hydra-headed,
hear. The dead and dying, by the hundred,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
lie all around; are borne bleeding through the streets,
towards help; the sight of them, like a torch of the
Furies, kindling Madness. Patriot Paris roars; as the
bear bereaved of her whelps. On, ye Patriots: Vengeance!
Victory or death! There are men seen, who
rush on, armed only with walking-sticks. Terror and
Fury rule the hour.</p>

<p>"The Swiss, pressed on from without, paralysed from
within, have ceased to shoot; but not to be shot.
What shall they do? Desperate is the moment.
Shelter or instant death: yet How, Where? One
party flies out by the Rue de l'Echelle; is destroyed
utterly, '<i>en entier</i>'. A second, by the other side, throws
itself into the Garden; 'hurrying across a keen fusillade';
rushes suppliant into the National Assembly;
finds pity and refuge in the back benches there. The
third, and largest, darts out in column, three hundred
strong, towards the Champs Elysées: 'Ah, could we
but reach Courbevoye, where other Swiss are!' Wo!
see, in such fusillade the column 'soon breaks itself by
diversity of opinion,' into distracted segments, this way
and that;&mdash;to escape in holes, to die fighting from street
to street. The firing and murdering will not cease;
not yet for long. The red Porters of Hôtels are shot
at, be they <i>Suisse</i> by nature, or <i>Suisse</i> only in name....</p>

<p>"Surely few things in the history of carnage are painfuller.
What ineffaceable red streak, flickering so sad
in the memory, is that, of this poor column of red Swiss
'breaking itself in the confusion of opinions'; dispersing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
into blackness and death! Honour to you, brave
men; honourable pity, through long times! Not
martyrs were ye; and yet almost more. He was no
King of yours, this Louis; and he forsook you like a
King of shreds and patches: ye were but sold to him
for some poor sixpence a-day; yet would ye work for
your wages, keep your plighted word. The work now
was to die; and ye did it. Honour to you, O Kinsmen."</p>

<p>Is that too dreadful an association for this spot? It
is terrible; but to visit Paris without any historical interest
is too materialistic a proceeding, and to have the
historical interest in Paris and be afraid of a little blood
is an untenable position. Paris is steeped in blood.</p>

<p>The Tuileries had not seen all its riot yet; July 29th,
1830, was to come, when, after another taste of monarchy,
revived in 1814 after its murder on that appalling
10th of August (which was virtually its death day, although
the date of the birth of the First Republic stands
as September 21st, 1793), the mob attacked the Palace,
the last Bourbon king, Charles X., fled from it and from
France, and Louis-Philippe of Orléans mounted the
throne in his stead. But that was not all. Another
seventeen and a half years and revengeful time saw
Louis-Philippe, last of the Orléans kings, escaping in
his turn from another besieging crowd, and the establishment
of the Second Republic.</p>

<p>During the Second Empire some of the old splendour
returned, and it was here, at the Tuileries, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
Napoleon III. drew up many of his plans for the modern
Paris that we now know; and then came the Prussian war
and the Third Republic, and then the terrible Communard
insurrection in the spring of 1871, in which the
Tuileries disappeared for ever. Napoleon III., as I have
said, assisted by Baron Haussmann, toiled in the great
pacific task of renovating Paris, not with the imaginative
genius of his uncle, but with an undeniable largeness
and sagacity. He it was who added so greatly to the
Louvre&mdash;all that part in fact opposite the Place du
Palais Royal and the Magasins du Louvre as far west
as the Rue de Rohan. A large portion of the corresponding
wing on the river side was his too. But here
is a list, since we are on the subject of modern Paris&mdash;which
began with the great Napoleon's reconstruction
of the ravages (beneficial for the most part) of the
Revolutionaries&mdash;of
the efforts made by each ruler since
that epoch. I borrow the table from the Marquis de
Rochegude.</p>

<p>"Napoleon I.&mdash;Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel, Vendôme
Column, Façade du Corps Legislatif, Commencement
of the Arc de Triomphe de l'Etoile, La Bourse,
the Bridges d'Austerlitz, d'Iéna, des Arts, de la Cité,
several Markets, Quais d'Orsay, de Billy, du Louvre,
Montebello, de la Tournelle; the Eastern and Northern
Cemeteries; numbering the houses in 1806, begun without
success in 1728; pavements in the streets and
doing away with the streams or flowing gutters in the
middle of the streets." (How like Napoleon to get the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
houses numbered on a clear system! Throughout Paris
the odd numbers occupy one side of the street and the
even the other. All are numbered from the Seine outwards.)</p>

<p>"The Restoration.&mdash;Chapel Expiatoire, N.D. de
Bonne-Nouvelle, N.D. de Lorette, St. Vincent de Paul;
Bridges of the Invalides, of the Archbishopric, d'Arcole;
Canals of St. Denis and St. Martin; fifty-five new streets;
lighting by gas." (It was about 1828 that cabs came
in. They were called fiacres from the circumstance that
their originator carried on his business at the sign of
the Grand St. Fiacre.)</p>

<p>"Louis-Philippe, 1830-1848.&mdash;Finished the Madeleine,
Arc de Triomphe, erected the Obelisk (Place de la Concorde),
Column of July; Bridges: Louis-Philippe, Carrousel;
Palace of the Quai d'Orsay; enlarged the Palais
de Justice; restored Notre Dame and Sainte Chapelle;
Fountains: Louvois, Cuvier, St. Sulpice, Gaillon,
Molière; opened the Museums of Cluny and the
Thermes. In 1843&mdash;1,100 streets.</p>

<p>"Napoleon III., 1852-1870.&mdash;Embellished Paris&mdash;execution
of Haussmann's plans, twenty-two new boulevards;
Streets Lafayette, Quatre-Septembre, de Turbigo; Bvd.
St. Germain; Rues des Ecoles, de Rivoli, the Champs
Elysées Quarter, the Avenues Friedland, Hoche, Kléber,
the Marceau, de L'Impératrice, many squares; a part of
new Louvre; Churches of St. Augustine, The Trinity,
St. Ambroise, Ste. Clotilde (finishing of); Theatres,
Châtelet, Lyrique, du Vaudeville; Tribunal of Commerce,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
Hôtel Dieu, Barracks, Central Markets (also the
ceinture railway); finishing of the Laribosière hospital,
the Fountain of St. Michel, the Bridges of Solferino,
L'Alma, the Pont au Change. In 1861, 1,667,841 inhabitants.</p>

<p>"The Commune.&mdash;Burning of the Tuileries, the
Ministry of Finance, the Louvre Library, the Hôtel de
Ville, the Palace of the Legion of Honour, the Palace
of the Quai d'Orsay, the Lyric, the Châtelet and the
Porte St. Martin theatres, etc.</p>

<p>"The Republic.&mdash;Reconstruction of the buildings
burnt by the Commune; Avenue de l'Opéra, the Opera
House; Streets: Etienne Marcel, Réaumur, Avenue de la
République, etc. In 1892, 4,090 streets, in 1902 there
were 4,261 streets. The Exhibition 1878 left the Trocadero,
and that of 1889 the Eiffel Tower, and that of
1900 the two Palaces of the Champs-Elysées and the
bridge Alexander III." (To this one should add the
Métro, still uncompleted, which has the advantage over
London's Tubes of being only just below the surface,
so that no lift is needed.)</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="carrousel" id="carrousel"></a>
<img src="images/i_176.jpg" width="650" height="443" alt="THE ARC DE TRIOMPHE DU CARROUSEL" />
<p class="caption">THE ARC DE TRIOMPHE DU CARROUSEL (WEST FAÇADE)</p></div>

<p>The Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel, at the east end
of the gardens, is a mere child compared with the Arc
de Triomphe de l'Etoile, which stands there, so serenely
and magnificently, at the end of the vista in the west,
nearly two amazing miles away; it could be placed
easily, with many feet to spare, under that greater
monument's arch (as Victor Hugo's coffin was); but it
is more beautiful. Both were the work of Napoleon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
both celebrate the victories of 1805-06. The Carrousel
is surmounted by a triumphal car and four horses; but
here again, as in the case of the statue of Henri IV.
on the Pont Neuf, there have been ironical changes.
Napoleon, when he ordained the arch, which was intended
largely to reproduce that of Severus at Rome,
ravished for its crowning the quadriga from St. Mark's
at Venice: those glorious gleaming horses over the
door. That was as it should be: he was a conqueror
and entitled to the spoils of conquest. But after his
fall came, as we have seen, a pedantic disgorgement of
such treasure; the golden team trotted back to the
Adriatic, and a new decoration had to be provided for
the Carrousel. Hence the present one, which represents&mdash;what?
It is almost inconceivable; but, Louis XVIII.
having commissioned it, it represents the triumph no
longer of Napoleon but of the Restoration! Amusing
to remember this under the Third Republic, as one
looks up at it and then at the bas-reliefs of the battle of
Austerlitz, the peace of Tilsit, the capitulation of Ulm,
the entry into Munich, the entry into Vienna and the
peace of Pressburg. Time's revenges indeed.</p>

<p>Standing under the Arc du Carrousel one makes the
interesting but disappointing discovery that the Arc de
Triomphe, the column of Luxor in the Place de la
Concorde, the fountain, the Arc du Carrousel, the
Gambetta monument and the Pavillon Sully of the
Louvre do not form a straight line, as by all the laws of
French architectural symmetry they should&mdash;especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
here, where compasses and rulers seem to have been
at work on every inch of the ground, and, as I have
ascertained, general opinion considers them to do. All
is well, from the west, until the Arc du Carrousel; it is
the Gambetta and the Pavilion Sully that throw it out.</p>

<p>The Gambetta! This monument fascinates me, not
by its beauty nor because I have any especial reverence
for the statesman; but simply by the vigour of his
clothes, the frock coat and the light overcoat of the
flamboyant orator, holding forth for evermore (or until
his hour strikes), urgent and impetuous and French.
To the frock coat in sculpture we in London are no
strangers, for have we not Parliament Square? but
our frock coats are quiescent, dead even, things of
stone. Gambetta's, on the contrary, is tempestuous&mdash;surely
the most heroic frock coat that ever emerged
from the quarries of Carrara. It might have been cut
by the Great Mel himself.</p>

<p>I have never seen a computation of the stone and
bronze population of Paris, but the statues must be
thousands strong. A Pied Piper leading them out of
the city would be worth seeing, although I for one
would regret their loss. Paris, I suppose, was Paris no
less than now in the days before Gambetta masqueraded
as a Frock Coated Victory almost within hail of the
Winged Victory of Samothrace; but Paris certainly
would not be Paris any more were some new turn of
the wheel to whisk him away and leave the Place du
Carrousel forlorn and tepid. The loss even of the smug
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
figure of Jules Simon, just outside Durand's, would be
something like a bereavement. I once, by the way,
saw this statue wearing, after a snowstorm, a white fur
cap and cape that gave him a character&mdash;something
almost Siberian&mdash;beyond anything dreamed of by the
sculptor.</p>

<p>It is not until one has walked through the gardens
of the Tuileries that the wealth of statuary in Paris
begins to impress the mind. For there must be almost
as many statues as flowers. They shine or glimmer
everywhere, as in the Athenian groves&mdash;allegorical,
symbolical, mythological, naked. The Luxembourg
Gardens, as we shall see, are hardly less rich, but there
one finds the statues of real persons. Here, as becomes
a formal garden projected by a king, realism is excluded.
Formal it is in the extreme; the trees are sternly
pollarded, the beds are mathematically laid out, the
paths are straight and not to be deviated from. None
the less on a hot summer's day there are few more delightful
spots, with the placid bonnes sitting so solidly,
as only French women can sit, over their needlework,
and their charges flitting like discreet butterflies all
around them; and here are two old philosophers&mdash;another
Bouvard and Pécuchet&mdash;discussing some problem
of conduct or science, and there a family party lunching
heartily, without shame. Pleasant groves, pleasant
people!</p>

<p>But the best thing in the Tuileries is M. Pol. Who
is M. Pol? Well, he may not be the most famous man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
in Paris, but he is certainly the most engaging. M. Pol
is the charmer of birds&mdash;"Le Charmeur d'oiseaux au
Jardin des Tuileries," to give him his full title. There
may be other charmers too at their pretty labours; but
M. Pol comes easily first: his personality is so attractive,
his terms of intercourse with the birds so intimate.
His oiseaux are chiefly sparrows, whom he knows by
name&mdash;La Princesse, Le Loustic, Garibaldi, La Baronne,
l'Anglais, and so forth. They come one by one at his
call, and he pets them and praises them; talks pretty
ironical talk; uses them (particularly the little brown
l'Anglais) for sly satirical purposes, for there are
usually a few English spectators; affects to admonish
and even chastise them, shuffling minatory feet with all
the noise but none of the illusion of seriousness; and
never ceases the while to scatter his crumbs or seeds of
comfort. It is a very charming little drama, and although
carried on every day, and for some hours every
day, it has no suggestion of routine; one feels that the
springs of it are sweetness and benevolence.</p>

<p>He is a typical elderly Latin, this M. Pol, a little
unmindful as to his dress, a little inclined to shamble:
humorous, careless, gentle. When I first saw him, years
ago, he fed his birds and went his way: but he now
makes a little money by it too, now and then offering,
very reluctantly, postcards bearing pictures of himself
with all his birds about him and a distich or so from
his pen. For M. Pol is a poet in words as well as
deeds: "De nos petits oiseaux," he writes on one card:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<p class="poem">
"De nos petits oiseaux, je suis le bienfaiteur,<br />
Et je vais tous les jours leur donner la pâture,<br />
Mais suivant un contrat dicté par la nature<br />
Quand je donne mon pain, ils me donnent leur c&oelig;ur."<br /></p>

<p>I think this true. It is a little more than cupboard
love that inspires these tiny creatures, or they would
never settle on M. Pol's hands and shoulders as they do.
He has charmed the pigeons also; but here he admits
to a lower motive:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Ils savent, les malins, que leur couvert est mis,<br />
C'est en faisant du bien qu'on se fait des amis."</p>

<p>It amused me one day at the Louvre to fix one of
these photographs in the frame of Giotto's picture of
St. Francis (in Salle VII.), one of the scenes of which
shows him preaching to the birds, thus bridging the
gulf between the centuries and making for the moment
the Assisi of the Saint and the Paris of M. Briand one.</p>

<p>London has its noticeable lovers of animals too&mdash;you
may see in St. Paul's churchyard in the dinner hour
isolated figures surrounded and covered by pigeons: the
British Museum courtyard also knows one or two, and
the Guildhall: quite like Venice, both of them, save
that no one is excited about it; while in St. James's
Square may be seen at all hours of every day the
mysterious cat woman with her pensioners all about
her on their little mats. Every city has these humorists&mdash;shall
I say? using the word as it was wont to be
used long ago. But M. Pol&mdash;M. Pol stands alone. It
is not merely that he charms the birds but that he is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
so charming with them. The pigeon feeders of London
whom I have watched bring their maize, distribute it and
go. M. Pol is more of a St. Francis than that: as I
have shown, he converses, jokes and exchanges moods
with his friends.</p>

<p>Although he is acquainted with pigeons, his real friends
are the gamins of the air, the sparrows, true Parisians,
who have the best news. Pigeons, one can conceive,
pick up a fact here and there, but it would have a
foreign or provincial flavour. Now if there is one thing
which bores a true Parisian it is talk of what is happening
outside Paris. The Parisian's horizons do not extend
beyond his city. The sun for him rises out of the Bois
de Vincennes, and evening comes because it has sunk into
the Bois de Boulogne. Hence M. Pol's wisdom in choosing
the sparrow for his companion, his oiseau intime.</p>

<p>So far had I written when I chanced to walk into
London by way of Hyde Park, and there, just by the
Achilles statue, was a charming gentleman in a tall
white hat whistling a low whistle to a little band of
sparrows who followed him and surrounded him and
fluttered up, one by one, to his hand. We talked a
little together, and he told me that the birds never forget
him, though he is absent for eight months each year.
His whistle brings them at once. So London is all right
after all. And I have been told delightful things about
the friends of the grey squirrels in Central Park; so
New York perhaps is all right too.</p>

<p>The Round Pond of Paris is at the Tuileries&mdash;not so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
vast as the <i>mare clausum</i> of Kensington Gardens, but
capable of accommodating many argosies. Leaving this
Pond behind us and making for the Place de la Concorde,
we have on the right the remains of a monastery of the
Cistercians, one of the many religious houses which stood
all about the north of the Gardens at the time of the
Revolution and were first discredited and emptied by
the votaries of Reason and then swept away by Napoleon
when he made the Rue de Rivoli. The building on
the left is the Orangery. It is in this part that the
temporary pavilions are erected for the banquets to provincial
mayors and such pleasant ceremonies, while in
the summer some little exhibition is usually in progress.</p>

<p>But what is that sound? The beating of a drum.
We must hasten to the gates, for that means closing
time.</p>

<p>The Place de la Concorde by day is vast rather
than beautiful, and by night it is a congress
of lamps. By both it is dangerous, and in bad weather
as exposed as the open sea. But it is sacred ground
and Paris is unthinkable without it. The interest of the
Place is summed up in the Luxor column, which may
perhaps be said to mark what is perhaps the most
critical site in modern history; for where the obelisk
now stands stood not so very long ago the guillotine.</p>

<p>The Place's name has been Concorde only since 1830
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
It began in 1763, when a bronze statue of Louis XV.
on horseback was erected there, surrounded by emblematic
figures, from the chisel of Pigalle, of Prudence,
Justice, Force and Peace. Hence the characteristic
French epigram:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"O la belle statue, O le beau piédestal!<br />
Les Vertus sont à pied, le Vice est à cheval."
</p>

<p>Before this time the Place had been an open and uncultivated
space; it was now enclosed, surrounded with
fosses, made trim, and called La Place Louis Quinze.
In 1770, however, came tragedy; for on the occasion of
the marriage of the Dauphin, afterwards the luckless
Louis XVI., with the equally luckless Marie Antoinette,
a display of fireworks was given, during which one of
the rockets (as one always dreads at every display)
declined the sky and rushed horizontally into the crowd,
and in the resulting stampede thousands of persons fell
into the ditches, twelve hundred being killed outright
and two thousand injured.</p>

<p>Twenty-two years later, kings having suddenly become
cheap, the National Convention ordered the statue
of Louis XV. to be melted down and recast into cannon,
a clay figure of Liberté to be set up in its stead, and
the name to be changed to the Place de la Révolution.
This was done, and a little later the guillotine was erected
a few yards west of the spot where the Luxor column
now stands, primarily for the removal of the head of
Louis XVI., in whose honour those unfortunate fireworks
had been ignited. The day was January 21st, 1793.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<p>"King Louis," says Carlyle, "slept sound, till five
in the morning, when Cléry, as he had been ordered,
awoke him. Cléry dressed his hair: while this went
forward, Louis took a ring from his watch, and kept
trying it on his finger; it was his wedding-ring, which
he is now to return to the Queen as a mute farewell.
At half-past six, he took the Sacrament; and continued
in devotion, and conference with Abbé Edgeworth. He
will not see his Family: it were too hard to bear.</p>

<p>"At eight, the Municipals enter: the King gives
them his Will, and messages and effects; which they,
at first, brutally refuse to take charge of: he gives them
a roll of gold pieces, a hundred and twenty-five louis;
these are to be returned to Malesherbes, who had lent
them. At nine, Santerre says the hour is come. The
King begs yet to retire for three minutes. At the end
of three minutes, Santerre again says the hour is come.
'Stamping on the ground with his right-foot, Louis
answers: "<i>Partons</i>, Let us go."'&mdash;How the rolling
of those drums comes in, through the Temple bastions
and bulwarks, on the heart of a queenly wife; soon to
be a widow! He is gone, then, and has not seen us?
A Queen weeps bitterly; a King's Sister and Children.
Over all these Four does Death also hover: all shall
perish miserably save one; she, as Duchesse d'Angoulême,
will live,&mdash;not happily.</p>

<p>"At the Temple Gate were some faint cries, perhaps
from voices of pitiful women: '<i>Grâce! Grâce!</i>' Through
the rest of the streets there is silence as of the grave.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
No man not armed is allowed to be there: the armed,
did any even pity, dare not express it, each man overawed
by all his neighbours. All windows are down,
none seen looking through them. All shops are shut.
No wheel-carriage rolls, this morning, in these streets but
one only. Eighty thousand armed men stand ranked,
like armed statues of men; cannons bristle, cannoneers
with match burning, but no word or movement: it
is as a city enchanted into silence and stone: one carriage
with its escort, slowly rumbling, is the only sound.
Louis reads, in his Book of Devotion, the Prayers of
the Dying: clatter of this death-march falls sharp on
the ear, in the great silence; but the thought would fain
struggle heavenward, and forget the Earth.</p>

<p>"As the clocks strike ten, behold the Place de la
Révolution, once Place de Louis Quinze: the Guillotine,
mounted near the old Pedestal where once stood the
Statue of that Louis! Far round, all bristles with
cannons and armed men: spectators crowding in the
rear; D'Orléans Egalité there in cabriolet. Swift messengers,
<i>hoquetons</i>, speed to the Townhall, every three
minutes: near by is the Convention sitting,&mdash;vengeful
for Lepelletier. Heedless of all, Louis reads his Prayers
of the Dying; not till five minutes yet has he finished;
then the Carriage opens. What temper he is in? Ten
different witnesses will give ten different accounts of it.
He is in the collision of all tempers; arrived now at the
black Maelstrom and descent of Death: in sorrow, in
indignation, in resignation struggling to be resigned.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
'Take care of M. Edgeworth,' he straitly charges the
Lieutenant who is sitting with them: then they two
descend.</p>

<p>"The drums are beating: '<i>Taisez-vous</i>, Silence!'
he cries 'in a terrible voice, <i>d'une voix terrible</i>'. He
mounts the scaffold, not without delay; he is in puce
coat, breeches of gray, white stockings. He strips off
the coat; stands disclosed in a sleeve-waistcoat of white
flannel. The Executioners approach to bind him: he
spurns, resists; Abbé Edgeworth has to remind him
how the Saviour, in whom men trust, submitted to be
bound. His hands are tied, his head bare, the fatal
moment is come. He advances to the edge of the
Scaffold, 'his face very red,' and says: 'Frenchmen, I
die innocent: it is from the Scaffold and near appearing
before God that I tell you so. I pardon my enemies:
I desire that France&mdash;&mdash;' A General on horseback,
Santerre or another, prances out, with uplifted hand:
'<i>Tambours!</i>' The drums drown the voice. Executioners,
do your duty!' The Executioners, desperate
lest themselves be murdered (for Santerre and his Armed
Ranks will strike, if they do not), seize the hapless
Louis: six of them desperate, him singly desperate,
struggling there; and bind him to their plank. Abbé
Edgeworth, stooping, bespeaks him: 'Son of Saint
Louis, ascend to Heaven'. The Axe clanks down; a
King's Life is shorn away. It is Monday the 21st of
January, 1793. He was aged Thirty-eight years, four
months and twenty-eight days.</p>

<p>"Executioner Samson shows the Head: fierce shout
of <i>Vive la République</i> rises, and swells; caps raised on
bayonets, hats waving; students of the College of Four
Nations take it up, on the far Quais; fling it over Paris.
D'Orléans drives off in his cabriolet: the Townhall
Councillors rub their hands, saying, 'It is done, It is
done'. There is dipping of handkerchiefs, of pike-points
in the blood. Headsman Samson, though he
afterwards denied it, sells locks of the hair: fractions of
the puce coat are long after worn in rings.&mdash;And so, in
some half-hour it is done; and the multitude has all
departed. Pastry-cooks, coffee-sellers, milkmen sing out
their trivial quotidian cries: the world wags on, as if
this were a common day. In the coffee-houses that
evening, says Prudhomme, Patriot shook hands with
Patriot in a more cordial manner than usual. Not till
some days after, according to Mercier, did public men
see what a grave thing it was."</p>

<p>The guillotine for more ordinary purposes worked in
the Place du Carrousel, not far from Gambetta's statue
to-day; but from May, 1793, until June, 1794, it was
back in the Place de la Concorde (then Place de la
Révolution) again, accounting during that time for no
fewer than 1,235 offenders, including Charlotte Corday,
Madame Roland and Marie Antoinette. The blood
flowed daily, while the tricoteuses looked on over their
knitting and the mob howled.</p>

<p>Another removal, to the Place de la Bastille, and then
on 28th July, 1794, the engine of justice or vengeance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
was back again to end a life and the Reign of Terror
in one blow. What life? But listen: "Robespierre,"
lay in an anteroom of the Convention Hall, while his
Prison-escort was getting ready; the mangled jaw bound
up rudely with bloody linen: a spectacle to men. He
lies stretched on a table, a deal-box his pillow; the
sheath of the pistol is still clenched convulsively in his
hand. Men bully him, insult him: his eyes still indicate
intelligence; he speaks no word. 'He had on the sky-blue
coat he had got made for the Feast of the <i>Être
Suprême</i>'&mdash;O Reader, can thy hard heart hold out
against that? His trousers were nankeen; the stockings
had fallen down over the ankles. He spake no word
more in this world.</p>

<p>"And so, at six in the morning, a victorious Convention
adjourns. Report flies over Paris as on golden wings;
penetrates the Prisons; irradiates the faces of those
that were ready to perish: turnkeys and <i>moutons</i>, fallen
from their high estate, look mute and blue. It is the
28th day of July, called 10th of Thermidor, year 1794.</p>

<p>"Fouquier had but to identify; his Prisoners being
already Out of Law. At four in the afternoon, never
before were the streets of Paris seen so crowded. From
the Palais de Justice to the Place de la Révolution,
for <i>thither</i> again go the Tumbrils this time, it is one
dense stirring mass; all windows crammed; the very
roofs and ridge-tiles budding forth human Curiosity,
in strange gladness. The Death-tumbrils, with their
motley Batch of Outlaws, some twenty-three or so,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
from Maximilien to Mayor Fleuriot and Simon the
Cordwainer, roll on. All eyes are on Robespierre's
Tumbril, where he, his jaw bound in dirty linen, with his
half-dead Brother and half-dead Henriot, lie shattered;
their 'seventeen hours' of agony about to end. The
Gendarmes point their swords at him, to show the
people which is he. A woman springs on the Tumbril;
clutching the side of it with one hand, waving the other
Sibyl-like; and exclaims: 'The death of thee gladdens
my very heart, <i>m'enivre de joie</i>'; Robespierre opened
his eyes; '<i>Scélérat</i>, go down to Hell, with the curses
of all wives and mothers!'&mdash;At the foot of the scaffold,
they stretched him on the ground till his turn came.
Lifted aloft, his eyes again opened; caught the bloody
axe. Samson wrenched the coat off him; wrenched the
dirty linen from his jaw: the jaw fell powerless, there
burst from him a cry;&mdash;hideous to hear and see. Samson,
thou canst not be too quick!</p>

<p>"Samson's work done, there bursts forth shout on
shout of applause. Shout, which prolongs itself not
only over Paris, but over France, but over Europe, and
down to this generation. Deservedly, and also undeservedly.
O unhappiest Advocate of Arras, wert thou
worse than other Advocates? Stricter man, according
to his Formula, to his Credo and his Cant, of probities,
benevolences, pleasures-of-virtue, and suchlike, lived not
in that age. A man fitted, in some luckier settled age,
to have become one of those incorruptible barren Pattern-Figures,
and have had marble-tablets and funeral-sermons.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
His poor landlord, the Cabinet-maker in the
Rue Saint-Honoré, loved him; his Brother died for him.
May God be merciful to him and to us!</p>

<p>"This is the end of the Reign of Terror."</p>

<p>In 1799 the Place won its name Concorde. The
next untoward sight that it was to see was Prussian and
Russian soldiers encamping there in 1814 and 1815, and
in 1815 the British. By this time it had been renamed
Place Louis Quinze, which in 1826 was changed to Place
Louis Seize, and a project was afoot for raising a monument
to that monarch's memory on the spot where he
fell. But the Revolution of 1830 intervened, and "Concorde"
resumed its sway, and in 1836 Louis-Philippe,
the new king (whose father, Philippe Egalité, had
perished on the guillotine here), erected the Luxor
column, which had been given to him by Mohammed
Ali, and had once stood before the great temple of
Thebes commemorating on its sides the achievements
of Rameses II. Since then certain symbolic statues of
the great French cities (including unhappy Strassburg)
have been set up, and the Place is a model of symmetry;
and at the time that I write (1909) a great part of it
is enclosed within hoardings for I know not what purpose,
but I hope a subway for the saving of the lives of
pedestrians, for it must be the most perilous crossing in
the world. One has but to set foot in the roadway and
straightway motor-cars and cabs spring out of the earth
and converge upon one from every point of the compass,
in the amazing French way. Concorde, indeed!</p>

If the Place de la Concorde may be called at night a
congress of lamps, the Champs-Elysées in the afternoon
may be said to be a congress of wheels. Wheels in such
numbers and revolving at such a pace are never seen in
England, not even on the Epsom road on Derby Day.
For there is no speed limit for the French motor-car.
Nor have we in England anything like this superb
roadway, so wide and open, climbing so confidently to
the Arc de Triomphe, with its groves on either side at
the foot, and the prosperous white mansions afterwards.
It is not our way. We English, with our ambition to
conquer and administer the world, have neglected our
own home; the French, with no ambition any longer
to wander beyond their own borders, have made their
home beautiful. The energy which we as a nation put
into greater Britain, they have put into buildings, into
statues, into roads. The result is that we have the
Transvaal, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and India,
but it is the French, foregoing such possessions and all
their anxieties, who have the Champs-Elysées.</p>

<p>The Champs-Elysées were planned and laid out by
Marie de Médicis in 1616, and the Cours la Reine, her
triple avenue of trees, still exists; but Napoleon is the
father of the scheme which culminates so magnificently
in the Arc de Triomphe. The particular children's
paradise of Paris is in the gardens between the main
road and the Elysée, where they bowl their hoops and
spin their Diabolo spools, and ride on the horses of
minute round-abouts turned by hand, and watch the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
marionettes, with the tired eyes of Alphonse Daudet,
who sits for ever, close by, in very white stone, watching
them. Here also are the open-air cafés, the Ambassadeurs
and the Alcazar, while on the other, the river, side
are the Jardin de Paris, a curiously Lutetian haunt, and
Ledoyen's, one of the pleasantest of restaurants in summer.</p>

<p>Just above this point we ought to turn to the left to
visit the Petit Palais and cross the Pont Alexandre
III., but since we are on the way let us now climb to
the Etoile, and on to the Bois, first, however, just turning
off the Rond-Point for a moment to look at No. 3
Avenue Matignon, where Heine (beside whose grave we
are to stand on Montmartre) suffered and died.</p>

<p>The Place de l'Etoile might be called a kind of gilt-edged
Seven Dials, since so many roads lead from it.
Aristocratic Paris comes to a head here. On the right
runs from it the Avenue de Friedland, leading to the
Boulevard Haussmann, which meets with so inglorious an
end at the Rue Taitbout, but is perhaps to be cut
through to join the Boulevard Montmartre. Next on
the right is the Avenue Hoche, running directly into
the Parc Monceau, a terrestrial paradise to which good
mondaines certainly go when they die. A little appartement
overlooking the Parc Monceau&mdash;there is tangible
heaven, if you like!</p>

<p>The Parc itself is small but perfect, elegant and expensive
and verdant. The children (one feels) are all
titled, the bonnes are visibly miracles of distinction and
the babies masses of point lace; the ladies on the chairs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
must be Comtesses or Baronnes, and the air is carefully
scented. That is the Parc Monceau. It needed but one
detail to make it complete, and that was supplied a few
years ago: a statue of Guy de Maupassant, consisting
of a block of the most radiant marble to be procured,
with the novelist as its apex, and at the base a Parisienne
reading one of his stories. Other statues there
are: of Ambroise Thomas the composer, to whom Mignon
offers a floral tribute; of Pailleron the dramatist, attended
by an actress; of Gounod surrounded by Marguerite,
Juliet, Sappho and a little Love; and of Chopin
seated at the piano, with the figures of Night and
Harmony to inspire him. These are only a few; but
they are typical. Every statue in the Parc has a
damsel or two, according to his desire. It is the mode.
There is also a minute lake, on the edge of which have
been set up a number of Corinthian columns; and before
you have been seated a minute, an old woman appears
from nowhere and demands twopence for what she
poetically calls an armchair, the extra penny being
added as a compliment to the two uncomfortable wires
at the side which you had been wishing you could break
off. Such is the Parc Monceau, the like of which exists
not in London: the ideal pleasaunce of the wealthy.
Through it, I might add, you may drive; but only at
a walking pace&mdash;<i>au pas</i>. If the horse were to trot he
might shake some petals off.</p>

<p>At the western gate is the Musée Cernuschi, containing
a collection of oriental pottery and bronzes. I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
no connoisseur of these beautiful things, but I advise
all readers of this book to visit both this museum and
the Guimet in the Place d'Iéna, which is a treasury of
Japanese and Chinese art.</p>

<p>Returning to the Etoile, the next avenue is the Avenue
de Wagram, running north to the Porte d'Asnières,
while that which continues the Avenue des Champs-Elysées
in a straight line west by north is the Avenue
de la Grande Armée, running to the Porte Maillot and
Neuilly. On the left the first avenue is the Avenue
Marceau, which leads to the Place de l'Alma; the next
the Avenue d'Iéna, leading to the Place d'Iéna; the
next, the Avenue Kléber, running straight to the Trocadéro
(into which I have never penetrated) and Passy,
where the English live; the next, the Avenue Victor
Hugo, which never stops; and finally the Avenue du Bois
de Boulogne, the most beautiful roadway in new Paris,
along which we shall fare when we have examined the
Arc de Triomphe.</p>

<p>This trophy of success was begun, as I have said, by
Napoleon to celebrate the victories of 1805 and 1806;
Louis-Philippe finished it in 1836. Why Louis XVIII.
did not destroy it or complete it as a further memorial
of the Restoration, I cannot say. Napoleon's original
idea was, however, tampered with by his successors, who
allowed a bas-relief representing the Blessings of Peace
in 1815 to be included. The sculptures are otherwise
wholly devoted to the glorification of war, Napoleon
and the French army; but they are not to be studied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
without serious inconvenience. My advice to the conscientious
student would be to buy photographs or
picture postcards, and examine them at home: the Arc
de Triomphe is too great and splendid for such detail.
From the top one can see all round Paris, and though
one cannot look down on it all as from the Eiffel Tower,
or see, beneath one, such an interesting district as from
Notre Dame, it is yet a wonderfully interesting view.</p>

<p>The Avenue du Bois de Boulogne has the finest road
in what is, so to speak, the Marais of the present day;
that is to say, in the modern quarter of the aristocratic
and wealthy. We have seen riches and rank moving
from the Marais to the Faubourg St. Germain and from
the Faubourg St. Germain to the Faubourg St. Honoré,
and now we find them here, and here they seem likely
to remain. And indeed to move farther would be
foolish, for surely there never was, and could not be, a
more beautiful city site than this anywhere in the world&mdash;with
its wide cool lawns on either side, and its gay
colouring, and the Bois so near. Here too, on the heads
of the comfortable complacent bonnes, are the most
radiant caps you ever saw.</p>

<p>The Bois de Boulogne, which takes its name from the
little town of Boulogne to the south of it, now a suburb
of Paris, began its life as a Paris park in the eighteen-fifties.
Before that it was a forest of great trees, which
indeed remained until the Franco-Prussian war, when
they were cut down in order that they might not give
cover to the enemy. That is why the present groves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
are all of a size. I cannot describe the Bois better than
by saying that it is as if Hyde Park, Sandown Park,
Kempton Park, and Epping Forest were all thrown
together between Shepherd's Bush, Acton and the river.
London would then have something like the Bois; and
yet it would not be like the Bois at all, because it would
rapidly become a desert of newspapers and empty bottles,
whereas, although in the summer populous with picnic
parties, the Bois is always clean and fresh.</p>

<p>There are several gates to the Bois, but the principal
ones are the Porte Maillot at the end of the Avenue de
la Grande Armée, and the Porte Dauphine at the end
of the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne, and it is through
the latter that the thousands of vehicles pass on their
way to the races on happy Sundays in the spring and
autumn. Most English people visiting the Bois merely
drive to the races and back again; it is quite the exception
to find any one who really knows the Bois&mdash;who
has walked round the two lakes, Lac Inférieur,
which feeds the cascade under which one may walk (as
at Niagara), and Lac Supérieur; who has seen a play
in the Théâtre de Verdure, or an exhibition at Bagatelle,
the villa of the late Sir Richard Wallace, who gave the
Champs-Elysées its drinking fountains and London the
Wallace Collection. Bagatelle now belongs to Paris.
Every English visitor, however, remembers the stone
animals, dogs and deer, in the lawn of the Villa de
Longchamp on the right as one approaches the race-course,
and the windmill on the left, one of the several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
inoperative windmills of Paris, which marks the site of
the old Abbey of Longchamp, founded by Isabella, the
sister of Saint Louis.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="venus" id="venus"></a>

<span class="s2">REMBRANDT</span><br />
<span class="s2"><i>(Louvre)</i></span></p></div>

<p>The Bois has two restaurants of the highest quality
and price&mdash;Armenonville, close to the Porte Maillot, a
favourite dining-place when the Fête de Neuilly is in
progress, in the summer, and the Pré Catelan, near Lac
Inférieur and close to the point where the Allée de la
Reine-Marguerite and the Allée de Longchamp cross.
In the summer it is quite the thing for the young
bloods who frequent the night cafés on Montmartre to
drive into the Bois in the early morning and drink a
glass of milk in the Pré Catelan's dairy, perhaps bringing
the milkmaids with them.</p>

<p>The Bois has two race-courses, but it is at Longchamp
that the principal races are run&mdash;the Grand Prix and
the Conseil Municipal. Racing men tell me that the
defect of the pari-mutuel system is that one cannot arrange
one's book, since the odds are always more or
less of a surprise; but to one who does not bet on horses
anywhere but in Paris, and who views an English bookmaker
with alarm, if not positive terror, the pari-mutuel
seems perfect in its easy and silent workings and the
dramatic unfolding of its surprises. For first you have
the fun of picking out your horse; then quietly putting
your money on him, to win or for a place; and then,
after the race is run and your horse is a winner, you
have those five to ten delightfully anxious minutes while
the actuaries are working out the odds.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span></p>

<p>An experience of my own will illustrate not only the
method of the system but the haphazard principles on
which a stranger's modest gambling can be done. On
the morning of the races I had visited the Louvre with
Mr. Dexter, the artist of this book. We had not much
time, and were therefore proposing to look only at the
Leonardos and the Rembrandts, which are separated
by a considerable stretch of gallery hung with other
pictures. On leaving the Leonardos we walked briskly
towards the Dutch end; Mr. Dexter, however, loitered
here and there, and I was some distance ahead when he
called me back to see a Holbein. It was worth going
back for. In the afternoon at Longchamp, when the
time came before the race to pick out the horses who
were to have the honour of carrying my money, I noticed
that one of them was named Holbein. Having already
that day been pleased with a Holbein, I accepted the
circumstance as a line of guidance, and placed a five-franc
piece on the brave animal. He came in first, and
being an outsider his price was 185.50.</p>

<p>The Longchamp course is perfectly managed. There
are three places where one may go&mdash;to the pesage,
which costs twenty francs for a cavalier and ten francs
for a dame; to the pavillon, which is half that price;
or to the pelouse, where the people congregate, which
costs a franc. Perfect order reigns everywhere.</p>

<p>For the wanderer who has no carriage awaiting him
and no appointments to hurry him there are two entertaining
things to do when the races are over on a fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
Sunday afternoon. One is to cross the Seine to Suresnes
by the adjacent bridge and sitting at the café that faces
it, watch the crowd and the traffic, for this is on a main
road from Paris to the country; or walking the other
way, one may enjoy a similar spectacle at the Café du
Sport outside the Porte Maillot and study at one's ease
the happy French in holiday mood&mdash;the husbands with
their wives and their two children, and the Sunday
lovers arm in arm.</p>

<p>And now we return to the Champs-Elysées in order
to look at some pictures and admire a beautiful bridge.
For the Avenue Alexandre III., as for the Pont Alexandre
III., Paris is indebted to the 1900 Exhibition.
These are her permanent gains, and very valuable they
are. Of the two white palaces on either side of this
green and spacious Avenue, that on the right, as we
face the golden dome of the Invalides, is the home of
the Salon and of various exhibitions. I say Salon, but
Paris now has many Salons, two of which, in more or
less amicable rivalry, occupy this building at the same
time. In one, the Salon proper, the Salon of the old
guard, the Royal Academicians of France, there are
miles of paint but few experiments; in the other, where
the more independent spirits&mdash;the New Englishers, so
to speak&mdash;hang their works in personal groups, there
are fewer miles but more outrages. For outrages, however,
pure and simple (or even impure and complex), I
recommend the Salon that is now held in the early
spring in some of the old Exhibition buildings on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
banks of the river, close to the Pont d'Alexandre III.
I have seen pictures there&mdash;nudities, in the manner of
Aztec decorations, by the youngest French artists of
the moment&mdash;which made one want to scream. It was
said once that the French knew how to paint but not
what to paint, and the English what to paint but not
how to paint it. Since then there has been such a fusing
of nationalities, such increased and humble appreciation
on the part of the English painters of the best French
methods, that one can no longer talk in that kind of
cast-iron epigram; but it is impossible to see some of
the crude innovating work now being done without the
reflection that France is rapidly and successfully creating
a school of artists who not only know not what to paint
but how to paint too.</p>

<p>The Palais des Beaux-Arts, which was built for the
collection of pictures at the Exhibition of 1900, is now
a permanent gallery for the preservation of the various
works of art acquired from time to time by the municipality
of Paris, thus differing from the Luxembourg collections,
which are national. The Palais has become a
kind of brother of the Carnavalet, the one being the
historical museum of Paris and the other&mdash;the Palais&mdash;the
artistic museum of Paris. The Palais undoubtedly
contains much that is not of the highest quality, but
no one who is interested in modern French painting
and drawing can afford to neglect it, while the recent
acquisition of the Collection Dutuit, consisting chiefly of
small but choice pictures of the Dutch masters, including
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
a picture of Rembrandt with his dog, from his own
hand, has added a rather necessary touch of antiquity.</p>

<p>One of the special rooms is devoted to pictures of the
opulent Félix Ziem, painter of Venetian sunsets and the
sky at its most golden, wherever it may be found, who
is still (1909) living in honourable state on those slopes
of the mountain of fame which are reserved for the few
rare spirits that become old masters before they die,
and who presented his pictures to Paris a few years ago;
another room is filled with the works of the late Jean
Jacques Henner, whose pallid nudities, emerging from
voluptuous gloom, still look yearningly at one from the
windows of so many Paris picture dealers. Henner, I
must confess, is not a painter whom I greatly esteem;
but few modern French artists were more popular in
their day. He died in 1905, and this gift of his work
was made by his son. Other French artists to have
rooms of their own in the Palais are Jean Carriès the
sculptor, who died in 1894 at the age of thirty-nine,
after an active career in the modelling of quaint and
grotesque and realistic figures, one of the best known
and most charming of his many works being "La Fillette
au Pantin" (No. 1338 in the collection); and
Jules Dalou (1838-1902), also a sculptor, a man of more
vigour although of less charm than his neighbour in
the Palais. That strange gift of untiring abundant
creativeness which the French have so notably, Dalou
also shared, his busy fingers having added thousands of
new figures to those that already congest life, while he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
modelled also many a well-known head. I think that
I like best his "Esquisses de Travailleurs". Nothing
here, however, is so fascinating as Dalou's own head by
Rodin in the Luxembourg.</p>

<p>Of the picture collection proper I am saying but
little, for it is in a fluid state, and even in the catalogue
before me, the latest edition, there is no mention of
several of its finest treasures: among them Manet's
portrait of Théodore Duret, a sketch of an old peasant
woman's hand by Madame David, a Rip Van Winkle
by that modern master of the grotesque and Rabelaisian,
Jean Véber, and one of Mr. Sargent's Venetian sketches&mdash;the
racing gondoliers. For the most part it is like
revisiting the past few Salons, except that the pictures
are more choice and less numerous; but one sees many
old friends, and all the expected painters are here. It
is of course the surprises that one remembers&mdash;the
three Daumiers, for example, particularly "L'Amateur
d'Estampes," reproduced <a href="#amateur">opposite page 286</a>, and "Les
Joueurs d'Echecs," and the fine collection of the drawings
of Puvis de Chavannes and Daniel Vierge. I was
also much taken with some topographical drawings by
Adrian Karbowski&mdash;No. 494 in the catalogue. Other
pictures and drawings which should be seen are those by
Cazin (a sunset), Pointelin, Steinlen (some work-girls),
Sisley, Lebourg, and Harpignies, who exhibits water-colours
separated in time by fifty-nine years, 1849 to 1908.
The drawings on a whole are far better than the paintings.</p>

<p>In the collection Dutuit look at Ruisdael's "Environs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
de Haarlem," Terburg's "La Fiancée," Hobbema's "Les
Moulins" and a woodland scene, Pot's "Portrait of a
Man," Van de Velde's landscape sketches, and the Rembrandt.
The rooms downstairs are not worth visiting.</p>

<p>Among the statuary, some of which is very good,
particularly a new unsigned and uncatalogued Joan of
Arc, is a naked Victor Hugo holding a MS. in his
hand; while Frémiet of course confronts the door, this
time with a really fine George and the Dragon, George
having a spear worthy of the occasion, and not the short
and useless broadsword which he brandishes on the
English sovereign.</p>

<p>On my last visit to this thinly populated gallery
I was for some time one of three visitors, until suddenly
the vast spaces were humanised by the gracious
and winsome presence of a band of Isidora Duncan's
gay little dancers, with a kindly companion to tell them
about the pictures, and&mdash;what interested them more&mdash;the
statues. These tiny lissome creatures flitting
among the cold rigid marbles I shall not soon forget.</p>

<p>And so we come to the Pont Alexandre III., the
bridge whose width and radiance are an ever fresh surprise
and joy, and make our way to the Invalides, at
the end of the prospect, across the great Esplanade des
Invalides, so quiet to-day, but for a month of every year,
so noisy and variegated with round-abouts and booths.
It is, by the way, well worth while, whenever one is
in Paris, to find out what fair is being held. For somewhere
or other a fair is always being held. You can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
get the particulars from the invaluable <i>Bottin</i> or <i>Bottin
Mondain</i>, which every restaurant keeps, and which is
even exposed to public scrutiny on a table at the Gare
du Nord, and for all I know to the contrary, at the
other stations too. This is one of the lessons which
might be learned from Paris by London, where you ask
in vain for a <i>Post Office Directory</i> in all but the General
Post Office. <i>Bottin</i>, who knows all, will give you the
time and place of every fair. The best is the Fête de
Neuilly, which is held in the summer, just outside the
Porte Maillot, but all the arrondissements have their
own. They are crowded scenes of noisy life; but they
are amusing too, and their popularity shows you how
juvenile is the Frenchman's heart.</p>

<p>One should enter the Invalides from the great Place
and round off the inspection of the Musée de l'Armée
by a visit to Napoleon's tomb; that, at least, is the
symmetrical order. The Hôtel des Invalides proper,
which set the fashion in military hospitals, was built by
Louis XIV., who may be seen on his horse in bas-relief
on the principal façade. The building once sheltered and
tended 7,000 wounded soldiers; but there are now only
fifty. From its original function as a military hospital
for any kind of disablement it has dwindled to a home
for a few incurables; while the greater portion of the
building is now given up to collections and to civic offices.
There could be no greater contrast than that between
the imposing architecture of the main structure and the
charming domestic façade in the Boulevard des Invalides,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
which is one of the pleasantest of the old Paris buildings
and has some of the simplicity of an English almshouse.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="pelerins" id="pelerins"></a>

<p class="caption">LES PÈLERINS D&#39;EMMAÜS<br />
<span class="s2">REMBRANDT</span><br />
<span class="s2"><i>(Louvre)</i></span></p></div>

<p>It is not until we enter the great Court of Honour
that we catch sight of Napoleon, whose figure dominates
the opposite wall. Thereafter one thinks of little else.
Louis XIV. disappears.</p>

<p>Passing some dingy frescoes which the weather has
treated vilely, we enter the Musée Historique on the
left&mdash;unless one has an overwhelming passion for
artillery, armour and the weapons of savages, in which
case one turns to the right. I mention the alternative
because there is far too much to see on one visit, and it
is well to concentrate on the more interesting. For me
guns and armour and the weapons of savages are without
any magic while there are to be seen such human
relics as have been brought together in the Musée Historique
on the opposite side of the Court. The whole
place, by the way, is a model for the Carnavalet, in that
everything is precisely and clearly labelled. This, since
it is a favourite resort of simple folk&mdash;soldiers and their
parents and sweethearts&mdash;is a thoughtful provision.</p>

<p>The Musée Historique has at every turn something
profoundly interesting, and incidentally it tells something
of the men from whom numbers of Paris streets
take their names; but the real and poignant interest is
Napoleon. The Longwood room is to me too painful.
The project of the admirable administrator has been to
illustrate the whole pageant of French arms; but the
Man of Destiny quickly becomes all-powerful, and one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
finds oneself looking only for signs and tokens of his
personality. So it should be, under the shadow of the
Dome which covers his ashes. I would personally go
farther and collect at the Invalides all the Napoleonic
relics that one now must visit so many places to see&mdash;the
Carnavalet, Fontainebleau, the Musée Grévin, our
own United Service Museum in Whitehall (as if we had
the right to a single article from St. Helena!), Madame
Tussaud's, and Versailles. There is even a room at the
Arts Décoratifs devoted nominally to Napoleon, but it has
few articles of personal interest and none of any intimacy&mdash;merely
splendid costumes for occasions and ceremonials
of State, with a few of Josephine's lace caps among them.
Its purpose is to illustrate the Empire rather than the
Emperor, but the Invalides should have what there is.</p>

<p>At the Invalides you may, I suppose, see in three or
four rooms more Napoleonic relics of a personal character
than anywhere else. In Whitehall is the chair he died
in; but here is his garden-seat from St. Helena, one bar
of which was removed to allow him as he sat to pass
his arm through and be more at his ease as he looked
out to the ocean that was to do nothing for him. At
Whitehall is the skeleton of his horse Marengo; here
is the saddle. Here are his grey redingote and more
than one of his hats. Among the relics in the special
Napoleonic rooms those of his triumph and his fall are
mixed. Here is the bullet that wounded him at Ratisbon;
here are his telescopes and his maps, his travelling
desks and his pistols; here are the toys of the little Duke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
of Reichstadt; here is the walking stick on which Napoleon
leaned at St. Helena, his dressing-gown, his bed, his
armchair and his death-mask. Here are the railings of
the tomb at St. Helena, and a case of leaves and stones
and pieces of wood and other natural surroundings of the
same spot. Here also is the pall that covered his coffin
on the way to its final burial under the Dome close by.</p>

<p>It is a fitting end to the study of these storied corridors
to pass to the tomb of the protagonist of the drama
we have been contemplating. The Emperor's remains
were brought to Paris in 1840, nineteen years after his
death at St. Helena. Thackeray, in his <i>Second Funeral
of Napoleon</i>, wrote a vivid, although to my mind hateful,
description of the ceremonial: a piece of complacent
flippancy, marked by the worst kind of French irreverence,
which shows him in his least admirable mood,
particularly when he is pleased to be amusing over the
difference between the features of the Emperor dead
and living. None the less it is an absorbing narrative.</p>

<p>One looks down upon the sarcophagus, which lies in
a marble well. It is simple, solemn and severe, and to
a few persons, not Titmarshes, inexpressibly melancholy.
The Emperor's words from his will, "Je désire que mes
cendres reposent sur les bords de la Seine, au milieu de
ce peuple français que j'ai tant aimé," are placed at the
entrance to the crypt. He had not the Invalides in
mind when he wrote them; but one feels that the
Invalides is as right a spot for him as any in this land
of short memories and light mockeries.</p>

THE BOULEVARD ST. GERMAIN AND ITS TRIBUTARIES</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>
<p class="blockquot">
An Aristocratic Quarter&mdash;Adrienne Lecouvreur&mdash;A Grisly Museum&mdash;A
Changeless City&mdash;The Pasteur Institute&mdash;The Golden Key&mdash;The
Stoppeur&mdash;Sterne&mdash;The Beaux Arts&mdash;A Wilderness of Copies&mdash;Voltaire
Clad and Naked&mdash;The Mint&mdash;An Inquisitive Visitor&mdash;Bad
Money.</p>

<p>From the Invalides the Boulevard St. Germain,
the west to east highway of the Surrey side of
Paris, is easily gained; but it is not in itself very interesting.
The interesting streets either cross it or run
more or less parallel with it, such as the old and winding
Rue de Grenelle, which we come to at once, the
home of the Parisian aristocracy after its removal from
the Marais. The houses are little changed: merely
the tenants; and certain Embassies are now here. No.
18 was once the Hôtel de Beauharnais, the home of the
fair Joséphine; at the Russian Embassy, No. 79, the
Duchesse d'Estrées lived. In an outhouse at No. 115
was buried in unconsecrated ground Adrienne Lecouvreur,
the tragedienne who made tragedy, the beloved of
Maréchal Saxe. Scribe's drama has made her story
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
known&mdash;how her heart was too much for her, and how
Christian burial was refused her by a Christian priest.</p>

<p>The Rue St. Dominique, parallel with the Rue de
Grenelle nearer the river, is equally old and august.
At No. 13 lived Madame de Genlis, the monitress of
French youth. Still nearer the river runs the long Rue
de l'Université, which also has an illustrious past and
a picturesque present, some great French noble having
built nearly every house.</p>

<p>One of the first old streets to cross the Boulevard St.
Germain is the Rue du Bac, a roadway made when the
Palace of the Tuileries was building, to convey materials
from Vaugiraud to the <i>bac</i> (or ferry boat) which crossed
the Seine where the Pont Royal now stands. This
street also is full of ancient palaces and convents.
Chateaubriand died at 118-120. At 128 is the Séminaires
des Missions Etrangères, with a terrible little
museum called the Chambre des Martyrs, very French
in character, displaying instruments of torture which
have been used upon missionaries in China and other
countries inimical (like poor Adrienne's priest) to Christianity.
The Rue des Saints-Pères resembles the Rue du
Bac, but is more attractive to the loiterer because it has
perhaps the greatest number of old curiosity shops of
any street in Paris. They touch each other: perhaps
they take in each other's dusting. I never saw a
customer enter; but that of course means nothing.
One might be sure of finding a case made of peau de
chagrin here and be equally sure that Balzac had trodden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
this pavement before you. You will see, however,
nothing or very little that is beautiful, because Paris
does not care much for sheer beauty.</p>

<p>The Rue des Saints-Pères runs upwards into the Rue
de Sèvres, where old convents cluster and the Bon
Marché raises its successful modern bulk. It was in the
Abbaye-aux-Bois, once at the corner of the Rue de
Sèvres and the Rue de la Chaise, but now buried beneath
a gigantic block of new flats, that Madame Récamier
lived from 1814 until her death in 1849, visited latterly
every day by the faithful Chateaubriand. M. Georges
Cain has a charming chapter on this friendship and its
scene in his <i>Promenades dans Paris</i>, of which an English
translation, entitled <i>Walks in Paris</i>, has recently
been published.</p>

<p>Returning to the Boulevard St. Germain, which we
leave as often as we touch it, I remember that, on the
south side, between the Invalides end and the statue of
the inventor of the semaphore, used to be a little shop
devoted to the sale of trophies of Joan of Arc. And since
it used to be there, it follows that it is there still, for
nothing in Paris ever changes. One of the great charms
of Paris is that it is always the same. I can think of
hardly any shop that has changed in the last ten years.
This means, I suppose, that the French rarely die.
How can they, disliking as they do to leave Paris? It
is the English and the Scotch, born to forsake their
homes and live uncomfortably foreign lives, who die.</p>

<p>If one is interested in seeing the Pasteur Institute,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
now is the time, for it is not far from the Rue de Sèvres,
in the Rue Falguière, named after Falguière the sculptor
of the memorial to Pasteur in the Place Breteuil: one
of the best examples of recent Paris statuary, with a
charming shepherd boy playing his pipe to his flock on
one side of the pediment, and grimmer scenes of disease
on the others. This monument, however, is some distance
from the Institute, the Place Breteuil being the
first carrefour in that vast and endless avenue which
leads southwards from Napoleon's tomb. The Institute
itself has a spirited statue of Jupille the shepherd, one
of its first patients, in his struggle with the wolf that
bit him. Pasteur's tomb is here, but I have not seen
it, as I arrived on the wrong day.</p>

<p>One of the most attractive of the Boulevard St.
Germain's byways is entered just round the corner of
the Rue de Rennes. This is the Cour du Dragon,
which is not only a relic of old Paris, but old Paris is
still visible hard at work in it. The Cour du Dragon
is a narrow court gained by an archway over which a
red dragon perches, holding up the balcony with his
vigorous pinions. It was the Hôtel Taranne in the
reigns of Charles VI. and VII. and Louis XI.; later
it became a famous riding and fencing school. It is
now a cheerful nest of artisans&mdash;coppersmiths, locksmiths,
coal merchants and the like, who fill it with brisk
hammerings, while at the windows above, with their
green shutters, the songs of caged birds mingle in the
symphony.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span></p>

<p>As in all Parisian streets or courts where signs are
hung, the golden key is prominent. (There is one in
Mr. Dexter's picture of the Rue de l'Hôtel de Ville.)
What the proportion of locksmiths is to the population
of Paris I cannot say; but their pretty symbol is to be
seen everywhere. The reason of their numbers is not
very mysterious when we recollect that practically every
one that one meets in this city, and certainly all the
people of the middling and working classes, live in flats,
and all want keys. The streets and streets of the small
houses with which East London is covered are unknown
in Paris, where every façade is but the mask which hides
vast tenements packed with families. No wonder then
that the serrurier is so busy.</p>

<p>Another sign which probably puzzles many English
people is that of the stoppeur. Bellows' dictionary does
not recognise the word. What is a stoppeur and what
does he stop? I discovered the answer in the most
practical way possible; for a Frenchman, in a crowd,
helped me to it by pushing his lighted cigar into my
back and burning a hole in it, right in the middle of
the coat, where a patch would necessarily show. I was in
despair until the femme de chambre reassured me. It was
nothing, she said: all that was needed was a stoppeur.
She would take the coat herself. It seems that the
stoppeur's craft is that of mending holes so deftly that
you would not know there had been any. He ascertains
the pattern by means of a magnifying glass, and then
extracts threads from some part of the garment that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
does not show and weaves them in. I paid three francs
and have been looking for the injured spot ever since,
but cannot find it. It is a modern miracle.</p>

<p>Diagonally opposite the Court of the Dragon is the
Church of St. Germain&mdash;not the St. Germain who owns
the church at the east end of the Louvre, but St. Germain
des Prés, a lesser luminary. It has no particular
beauty, but a number of frescoes by Flandrin, the pupil
of Ingres, give it a cachet. Flandrin's bust is to be observed
on the north wall. The frescoes cannot be seen
except under very favourable conditions, and therefore
for me the greatness of Flandrin has to be sought in his
drawings at the Luxembourg and the Louvre&mdash;sufficient
proof of his exquisite hand.</p>

<p>Before descending the Rue Bonaparte to the river,
let us ascend it to see the great church of St. Sulpice
and its paintings by Delacroix in the Chapel of the
Holy Angels. Under the Convention St. Sulpice was
the Temple of Victory, and here General Bonaparte
was feasted in 1799. The church is famous for its
music and an organ second only to that of St. Eustache.
And now let us descend the Rue Bonaparte to the
quais, where several buildings await us, beginning with
the Beaux-Arts at the foot of the street; but first the
Rue Jacob, which bisects the Rue Bonaparte, should
be looked at, for it has had many illustrious inhabitants,
including our own Laurence Sterne, who lodged here,
at No. 46, in the Hôtel of his friend Madame Rambouillet
(of the easy manners) when he was studying the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
French for <i>A Sentimental Journey</i>. It was here
perhaps that he penned the famous opening sentence:
"'They order,' said I, 'these things better in France'"&mdash;which
no other writer on Paris has succeeded in forgetting.
At No. 20 lived Adrienne Lecouvreur, and
hither Voltaire must often have come, for he greatly admired
her. At No. 7 is a fine old staircase and an old
well in the court.</p>

<p>The Palais des Beaux-Arts, where the Royal Academy
Schools of Paris are situated, is an unexhilarating building
containing a great number of unexciting paintings.
Indeed, I think that no public edifice of Paris is so
dreary: within and without one has a sense not exactly
of decay but certainly of neglect. This is not the less
odd when one thinks of the purpose of the institution,
which is to foster the arts, and when one thinks also
of the spotless perfection in which the Petit Palais, the
latest of the Parisian picture galleries, is maintained.
The spirit, however, is willing, if the flesh is weak, for
in the first and second courts are examples of the best
French architecture, and a bust of Jean Goujon is let
into the wall of the Musée des Antiques. The building
contains a number of casts of the best sculptures and
an amphitheatre with Delaroche's pageant of painters
on the hemicycle and Ingres' Victory of Romulus over
the Sabines opposite it; but there is not always enough
light to see either well. For the best view of Delaroche's
great work one must go upstairs to the Gallery. The
library also is upstairs, with many thousand of valuable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
works on art and a collection of drawings by the masters,
access to which is made easy to genuine students.</p>

<p>By returning to the first court we come to the Musée
de la Renaissance, which now occupies an old chapel of
the Couvent des Petits-Augustins, on the site of which
the Palais de Beaux-Arts was built. Here are more
casts and copies, and there are still more in the adjoining
Cour du Mûrier, where stands the memorial of
Henri Regnault, the painter, and the students who
died with him during the defence of Paris in 1870-71.</p>

<p>We then enter the Salle de Melpomène, so called
from the dominating cast of the Melpomene at the
Louvre, and are straightway among what seem at the
first glance to be old friends from all the best galleries
of the world but too quickly are revealed as counterfeits.
Rembrandt's School of Anatomy and the Syndics, our
own National Gallery Correggio, the Dresden Raphael,
the Wallace Collection Velasquez (the Lady with a Fan),
one of Hals' groups of arquebusiers, and Paul Potter's
Bull: all are here, together with countless others, all the
work of Beaux-Arts students, and some exceedingly
good, but also (like most copies) exceedingly depressing.</p>

<p>In other rooms almost pitch dark are modelled studies
of expression and paintings which have won the Grand
Prix of Rome during the past two hundred years. It
is odd to notice how few names one recognises: it is as
though, like the Newdigate, this prize were an end in
itself.</p>

<p>Having contemplated the statue of Voltaire in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
robes outside the Institut, the next building of importance
after the Beaux Arts, you may, if you so desire,
gaze upon the same philosopher in a state of nature by
entering the Institut itself, and ascending to its Bibliothèque.
There he sits, the skinny cynic, among the
books which he wrote and the books which he read and
the books which would not have been written but for
him. I was glad to see him thus, for it showed me
where our own Arouet, Mr. Bernard Shaw, found his
inspiration when he too subjected recently his economical
frame to the maker of portraits. Mr. Shaw sat, however,
only to a photographer (although a very good
one, Mr. Coburn); when he visited Rodin it was for the
head, a replica of which may be seen at the Luxembourg.
Speaking of heads, the Institut is a wilderness of them:
heads line the stairs; heads line the walls not only of
its own Bibliothèque but of the Bibliothèque de Mazarin,
which also is here, a haven for every student that cares
to seek it: heads of the great Frenchmen of all time
and of the Cæsars too.</p>

<p>The Pont des Arts, which leads direct from the old
Louvre to the Institut (a connection, if ever, no longer
of any importance), is for foot passengers only. One is
therefore more at ease there in observing the river than
on the noisy bridge of stone. But it is inexcusably ugly
and leaves one continually wondering what Napoleon
was about to allow it to be built&mdash;and of iron too&mdash;in
his day of good taste. Looking up stream, the Pont
Neuf is close by with the thin green end of the Cité's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
wedge protruding under it and, in winter, Henri IV.
riding proudly above. In summer, as Mr. Dexter's
drawing shows, he is hidden by leaves. A basin has
been constructed at this point from which the tide is
excluded, and here are washing houses and swimming
baths; for Parisians, having a river, use it.</p>

<span class="s2"><i>(Louvre)</i></span></p></div>

<p>The Hôtel des Monnaies, close by the Beaux Arts, is
another surprise. One would expect in such a country
as France, with its meticulously exact control of its
public offices, that its Mint, the institution in which its
money was made, would be a miracle of precision and
efficiency. Efficiency it may have; but its proceedings
are casual beyond belief: the workmen in the furnaces
loaf and smoke and stare at the visitors and exchange
comments on them; the floors are cluttered up with
lumber; the walls are dirty; the doors do not fit. A
very considerable amount of work seems to be accomplished&mdash;there
are machines constantly in movement
which turn out scores of coins a minute, not only for
France but for her few and dispiriting colonies and
for other countries; and yet the feeling which one
has is that France here is noticeably below herself.</p>

<p>I was shown round by a very charming attendant,
who handled the new coins as though he loved them
and took precisely that pride in the place that the
Government seems to lack. The design on the French
franc, although it ought to be cut, I think, a little
deeper, a little more boldly, is very attractive, both
obverse and reverse, and it is a pleasant sight to see the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
bright creatures tumbling out of the machine as fast as
one can count. Pleasanter still is it to the frail human
eye when the same process is repeated with golden
Louis'&mdash;baskets full of which stand negligently about
as though it were the cave of the Forty Thieves.</p>

<p>An Englishman's perhaps indiscreet questions as to
what precautions were taken to prevent leakage amused
the guide beyond all reason. "It is impossible," he
said; "the coins are weighed. They must correspond
to the prescribed weight." "But who," my countryman
went on, in the relentless English way, "checks the
weigher?" "Another," said the guide. "But a time
must come," continued the Briton, who probably had a
business of his own and had suffered, "when there is no
one left to check&mdash;when the last man of all is officiating:
how then?" Our guide laughed very happily, and
repeated that there were no thieves there; and I daresay
he is right. "Perhaps," I said, to the English
inquisitor, "perhaps, like assistants in sweet shops, they
are allowed at first to help themselves so much that they
acquire a disgust for money." He looked at me with
eyes of stone. I think he had Scotch blood. "Perhaps,"
he said at last.</p>

<p>My own contribution to the guide's entertainment
was the production, before a machine that was shooting
five-franc pieces into a bowl at the rate of one a second,
of the four bad (démonétisé) coins of the same value
which had been forced upon me during the few days
I had then been in Paris. They gave immense delight.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
Several mintners (or whatever they are called) stopped
working in order to join in the inspection. It was the
general opinion that I had been badly treated: although,
of course, I ought to have known. Three of the coins
were simply those of other nations no longer current in
France, and for them I could get from two to three
francs each at an exchange. Unless, of course, a man
of the world put in, I liked to sell them to a waiter, and
then I should get perhaps a slightly better price. "Be
careful, however," said he, "that he does not give them
back to you in the next change."  The fourth coin
was frankly base metal and ought not to have taken in
a child. That, by the way, was given to me at a Post
Office, the one under the Bourse, and I find that Post
Offices are notorious for this habit with foreigners.
The mintners generally agreed that it was a scandal,
but they did so without heat&mdash;bearing indeed this misfortune
(not their own) very much as their countryman
La Rochefoucauld had observed men to do.</p>

<p>After the coins we saw the medal-stampers at work,
each seated in a little hole in the ground before his
press. The French have a natural gift for the designing
of medals, and they are interested in them as souvenirs
not only of public but of private events&mdash;such as silver
weddings, birthdays and other anniversaries. Upstairs
there is a collection of medals by the best designers&mdash;such
as Roty, Patey, Carial, Chaplain, Dupuis, Dupré&mdash;many
of them charming. Here also are collections of
the world's coinage and of historical French medals.</p>

THE LATIN QUARTER</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span></p>
<p class="blockquot">
Old Prints&mdash;Procope, Tortoni, and Le Père Lunette&mdash;The Luxembourg
Palace&mdash;Rodin&mdash;Modern Paintings&mdash;A Sinister Crypt&mdash;A
Garden of Sculpture&mdash;The Students of the Latin Quarter&mdash;The
Sorbonne&mdash;A Beautiful Museum&mdash;The Cluny's Treasures&mdash;Marat
and Danton&mdash;Old Streets and Dirty&mdash;The River Bièvre&mdash;Inspired
Topography&mdash;Dante in Paris.</p>

<p>The high road from the centre of Paris to the
Latin Quarter is across the Pont du Carrousel
and up the narrow Rue Mazarine, which skirts the
Institut. We have seen on the Quai des Célestins the
site of one of Molière's theatres: here, at Nos. 12-14, is
the house in which he established his first theatre, on
the last day of 1643. The Rue Mazarin runs into the
Rue de l'Ancienne Comédie Française, at No. 14 in
which was that theatre, whose successor stands at the
foot of the Rue Richelieu. Parallel with the Rue
Mazarin is the Rue de Seine, interesting for its old
print shops, not the least interesting department of
which is the portfolios containing students' sketches,
some of them very good. (I might equally have said
some of them very bad.)</p>

<p>Crossing the Boulevard St. Germain we climb what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
is now the Rue de l'Odéon to the Place and theatre of
that name, with the statue of Augier the dramatist
before it. The Place de l'Odéon demands some attention,
for at No. 1, now the Café Voltaire, was once the
famous Café Procope, very significant in the eighteenth
century, the resort of Voltaire and the Encyclopædists,
and later of the Revolutionaries. Camille Desmoulins
indeed made it his home. You may see within portraits
of these old famous habitués. Procopio, a Sicilian
who founded his establishment for the shelter of poor
actors and students (whom Paris then loathed in private
life), was the father of all the Paris cafés.</p>

<p>The Café Procope was to men of intellect what some
few years later Tortoni's was to men of fashion. The
Café Tortoni was in the Boulevard des Italiens. Let
Captain Gronow tell its history: "About the commencement
of the present [nineteenth] century, Tortoni's, the
centre of pleasure, gallantry, and entertainment, was
opened by a Neapolitan, who came to Paris to supply
the Parisians with good ice. The founder of this celebrated
café was by name Veloni, an Italian, whose father
lived with Napoleon from the period he invaded Italy,
when First Consul, down to his fall. Young Veloni
brought with him his friend Tortoni, an industrious and
intelligent man. Veloni died of an affection of the
lungs, shortly after the café was opened, and left the
business to Tortoni; who, by dint of care, economy, and
perseverance, made his café renowned all over Europe.
Towards the end of the first Empire, and during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
return of the Bourbons, and Louis Philippe's reign, this
establishment was so much in vogue that it was difficult
to get an ice there; after the opera and theatres were
over, the Boulevards were literally choked up by the
carriages of the great people of the court and the Faubourg
St. Germain bringing guests to Tortoni's.</p>

<p>"In those days clubs did not exist in Paris, consequently
the gay world met there. The Duchess of
Berri, with her suite, came nearly every night incognito;
the most beautiful women Paris could boast of, old
maids, dowagers, and old and young men, pouring out
their sentimental twaddle, and holding up to scorn their
betters, congregated here. In fact, Tortoni's became
a sort of club for fashionable people; the saloons were
completely monopolised by them, and became the rendez-vous
of all that was gay, and I regret to add, immoral.</p>

<p>"Gunter, the eldest son of the founder of the house
in Berkeley Square, arrived in Paris about this period,
to learn the art of making ice; for prior to the peace,
our London ices and creams were acknowledged, by the
English as well as foreigners, to be detestable. In the
early part of the day, Tortoni's became the rendez-vous
of duellists and retired officers, who congregated in
great numbers to breakfast; which consisted of cold
pâtés, game, fowl, fish, eggs, broiled kidneys, iced
champagne, and liqueurs from every part of the globe.</p>

<p>"Though Tortoni succeeded in amassing a large
fortune, he suddenly became morose, and showed evident
signs of insanity: in fact, he was the most unhappy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
man on earth. On going to bed one night, he said to
the lady who superintended the management of his café,
'It is time for me to have done with the world'. The
lady thought lightly of what he said, but upon quitting
her apartment on the following morning, she was told
by one of the waiters that Tortoni had hanged himself."</p>

<p>Some one should write a book&mdash;but perhaps it has
been done&mdash;on the great restaurateurs. Paris would, of
course, provide the lion's share; but there would be
plenty of material to collect in other capitals. The life of
our own Nicol of the Café Royal, for example, would not
be without interest; and what of Sherry and Delmonico?</p>

<p>While on the subject of meeting-places of remarkable
persons, I might say that a latter-day resort of
intellectuals who have allowed the world and its temptations
to be too much for them is not so very far away from
us at this point&mdash;the cabaret of Le Père Lunette at No. 4
Rue des Anglais. I do not say that this is a modern
Procope, but it has some of the same characteristics:
men of genius have met here and illustrious portraits
are on the wall; but they are not frescoes such as
could be included in this book, for old Father Spectacles
puts satire before propriety.</p>

<p>In the colonnade round the Odéon theatre are bookstalls,
chiefly offering new books at very low rates. We
emerge on the south side in the Rue Vaugiraud, with
the Médicis fountain of the Luxembourg just across the
road. The Luxembourg Palace was built by Marie de
Médicis, the widow of Henri IV., and it fulfilled the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
functions of a palace until the Revolution, when, prisons
being more important than palaces, it became a prison.
Among those conveyed hither were the Vicomte de
Beauharnais and his wife Joséphine, who was destined
one day to be anything but a prisoner. After the
Revolution the Luxembourg became the Palace of the
Directoire and then the Palace of the First Consul. In
1800 Napoleon moved to the Tuileries, and a little while
afterwards he established the Senate here, and here it is
still. I cannot describe the Palace, for I have never
been in it, but the Musée I know well.</p>

<p>The Luxembourg galleries are dedicated to modern
art. They have nothing earlier than the nineteenth
century, and may be said to carry on the history of
French painting from the point where it is left in Room
VIII. at the Louvre, while little is quite so modern as
the permanent portion of the Petit Palais. One plunges
from the street directly into a hall of very white sculpture,
which for the moment affects the sight almost like
the beating wings of gulls. The difference between
French and English sculpture, which is largely the difference
between nakedness and nudity, literally assaults
the eye for the moment; and then the more beautiful
work quietly begins to assert itself&mdash;Rodin's "Pensée,"
on the left, holding the attention first and gently soothing
the bewildered vision. Rodin indeed dominates this
room, for here are not only his "Pensée" (the "Penseur"
is not so very far away, two hundred yards or so, at the
Panthéon), but his "John the Baptist," gaunt and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
urgent in the wilderness (with Dubois' "John the
Baptist as a boy" near by, to show from what material
prophets are evolved) and the exquisite "Danaïdes"
and the "Age d'Airain," and the giant heads of Hugo
and Rochefort, and the little delicate sensitive Don
Quixotic head of Dalou the sculptor, which has just
been added, and the George Wyndham and the G.B.S.
and other recent portraits; while through the doorway
to the next room one sees the "Baiser," immense and
passionate. I reproduce both the "Baiser," <a href="#baiser">opposite
page 294</a>, and the "Pensée," <a href="#pensee">opposite page 46</a>.</p>

<p>Other work here that one recalls is the charming
group by Frémiet, "Pan and the Bear Cubs," Dubois'
fascinating "Florentine Singing-boy of the Fifteenth
Century," a peasant by Dalou, a Great Dane and puppies
by Le Courtier, and the very beautiful head in the
doorway to Room I.&mdash;"Femme de Marin," by Cazin the
painter. But other visitors, other tastes, of course.</p>

<p>Before entering Room I. there are two small rooms on
the right of the sculpture gallery which should be entered,
one given up to the more famous Impressionists and
one to foreign work. The chief Impressionists are
Degas, Renoir, Monet, Sisley and their companions, almost
all of whom seem to me to have painted better elsewhere
than here. Monet's "Yachts in the River" rise
before me, as I write, with the warm sun upon them, and
I still see in the mind's eye the torso of a young woman
by Legros: but this room always depresses me, the
effect largely I believe of the antipathetic Renoir. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
other room has a floating population. Recently the
painters have been Belgian: but at another time they
may be German or English, when the Belgians will
recede to the cellars or be lent to provincial galleries.</p>

<p>The pictures in the Luxembourg are many, but the
arresting hand is too seldom extended. Cleverness, the
bane of French art, dominates. In the first room
Rodin's "Baiser" is greater than any painting; but
Harpignies' "Lever de Lune" is here, and here also is
one of Pointelin's sombre desolate moorlands. In a
glass case some delicate bowls by Dammouse are worth
attention; but I think his work at the Arts Décoratifs
at the Louvre is better. The second room is notable
for the Fantin-Latour drawings in the middle, with others
by Flandrin and Meissonier; the third for Carolus-Duran's
"Vieux Lithographe" and a case of drawings
by modern black and white masters, including Legros
and Steinlen; here also is another Pointelin. In Room
IV. is a coast scene&mdash;"Les Falaises de Sotteville," in a
lovely evening light, by Bouland, which falls short of
perfection but is very grateful to the eyes. In Room
V. is a portrait group by Fantin-Latour recalling the
"Hommage à Delacroix," which we saw in the Collection
Moreau, but less interesting. The studio is that of
Manet at Batignolles. Here also is a beautiful snow
scene by Cazin&mdash;an oasis indeed. In Room VI. we find
Cazin again with "Ishmael," and two sweet and misty
Carrières, a powerful if hard Legros, Carolus-Duran's
portrait of the ruddy Papa Français the painter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
Blanche's vivid group of the Thaulow family, with the
gigantic Fritz bringing the strength of a bull-fighter
to the execution of one of his tender landscapes, and
finally Whistler's portrait of his mother, which I reproduce
on the <a href="#mere">opposite page</a>&mdash;one of the most restful and
gentlest deeds of his restless, irritable life.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="mere" id="mere"></a>
<img src="images/i_242.jpg" width="650" height="577" alt="PORTRAIT DE SA MÈRE" />
<p class="caption">PORTRAIT DE SA MÈRE<br />
<span class="s2">WHISTLER</span><br />
<span class="s2"><i>(Luxembourg)</i></span></p></div>

<p>Room VII. is remarkable for Rodin's "Bellona" and
Tissot's curious exercises in the genre of W. P. Frith&mdash;the
story of the Prodigal Son. But the picture which
I remember most clearly and with most pleasure is
Victor Mottez's "Portrait of Madame M.," which has a
deep quiet beauty that is very rare in this gallery. In
the same room, placed opposite each other, although
probably not with any conscious ironical intention, are
a large scene in the Franco-Prussian War by De Neuville,
and Carrière's "Christ on the Cross". In Room VIII. are
a number of meretricious Moreaus, Caro-Delvalle's light
and, to me, oddly attractive, group, "Ma Femme et
ses S&oelig;urs," and the portrait of Mlle. Moréno of the
Comédie Française by Granié, which is reproduced <a href="#bergere">opposite
page 308</a>, a picture with fascination rather than
genius.</p>

<p>In the doorway between Room VIII. and Room IX.
hangs a small water-colour by Harpignies, but in Room
IX. itself is nothing that I can recollect. Room X. has
Picard's charming "Femme qui passe," Harpignies'
Coliseum, very like a Moreau Corot, and a Flandrin;
and in Room XI. are Bastien Lepage's "Portrait of M.
Franck," Le Sidaner's "Dessert," Vollon's "Port of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
Antwerp," very beautiful, and Carolus-Duran's famous
portrait of "Madame G. F. and her children".</p>

<p>On leaving the Musée it is worth while to take a few
steps more to the left, for they bring us to another
sinister souvenir of the Reign of Terror&mdash;to St. Joseph
des Carmes, the Chapel of the Carmelite monastery in
which, in September, 1792, the Abbé Sicard and other
priests who had refused to take the oath of the Constitution
were imprisoned and massacred, as described
by Carlyle in Book I., Chapters IV. and V. of "The
Guillotine," with the assistance of the narrative of one
of the survivors, <i>Mon Agonie de Trente-Huit Heures</i>,
by Jourgniac Saint-Méard. In the crypt one is shown
not only the tombs but traces of the massacre.</p>

<p>A walk in the Luxembourg gardens would, if one
had been nowhere else, quickly satisfy the stranger as to
the interest of the French in the more remarkable
children of their country. In these gardens alone are
statues, among many others, in honour of Chopin,
Watteau, Delacroix, Sainte-Beuve, Le Play the economist,
Fabre the poet, George Sand, Henri Murger, the
novelist of the adjacent Latin Quarter, and Théodore
de Banville, the modern maker of ballades and prime
instigator of some of the most charming work in French
form by Mr. Lang and Mr. Dobson and W. E. Henley.
There are countless other statues of mythological and
allegorical figures, some of them very striking. One
of the most interesting of all is the "Marchand de
Masques" by Astruc, among the masks offered for sale
being those of Corot, Dumas, Berlioz and Balzac.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span></p>

<p>The Luxembourg gardens lead to the Avenue de
l'Observatoire, a broad and verdant pleasaunce with a
noble fountain at the head, in the midst of which an
armillary sphere is held up by four undraped female
figures representing the four quarters of the globe, at
whom a circle of tortoises spout water from the surface of
the basin. Beneath the upholders of the sphere are eight
spirited sea horses by Frémiet, the sculptor who designed
"Pan and the Bear Cubs" in the Luxembourg.</p>

<p>A few yards to the west of this fountain is one of
the simplest and most satisfying of Parisian sculptured
memorials, at the corner of the Rue d'Assas and the
Boulevard de l'Observatoire&mdash;the bas-relief on the Tarnier
maternity hospital, representing the benevolent
Tarnier in his merciful work.</p>

<p>Let us now descend the Boulevard St. Michel to the
Sorbonne, which is the heart of the Latin Quarter (or
perhaps the brain would be the better word), disregarding
for the moment the Panthéon, and turning our backs on
the Observatoire and the Lion de Belfort, in the streets
around which, every September, the noisiest of the
Parisian fairs rages, and on the Bal Bullier, where the
shop assistants of this neighbourhood grasp each other
in the dance every Thursday and Sunday night. Not
that this high southern district of Paris is not interesting;
but it is far less interesting than certain parts
nearer the Seine, and this book may not be too long.</p>

<p>The Sorbonne is not exciting, but it is not unamusing
to watch young France gaining knowledge. I have
called it the heart of the Latin Quarter, although when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
one thinks of the necessitous, irresponsible youthful populace
of these slopes, it is rather in a studio than in a
lecture centre that one would fix its cardiac energy.
That, however, is the fault of Du Maurier and Murger;
for I suppose that for every artist that the Latin Quarter
fosters it has scores of other students. But here I am
in unknown territory. This book, which describes (as
I warned you) Paris wholly from without, is never so
external as among the young bloods who are to be met
at night in the Café Harcourt, or who dance at the
annual ball of the Quatz'-Arts, or plunge themselves into
congenial riots when unpopular professors mount the
platform. I know them not; I merely rejoice in their
existence, admire their long hair and high spirits and
happy indigence, and wish I could join them among
Jullien's models, or in the disreputable cabaret of Le
Père Lunette, or at a solemn disputation, such as that
famous one in which the sophist Buridan, after being
thrown into the Seine in a sack and rescued, "maintained
for a whole day the thesis that it was lawful to slay a
Queen of France".</p>

<p>The Sorbonne takes its name from Robert de Sorbon,
the confessor of St. Louis, who had suffered much as
a theological student and wished others to suffer less;
for students in his day existed absolutely on charity.
St. Louis threw himself into his confessor's scheme, and
the Sorbonne, richly endowed, was opened in 1253, in
its original form occupying a site in a street with the
depressing name of Coupe-Gueule. From a hostel it soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
became the Church's intellect, and for five and a half
centuries it thus existed, almost continually, I regret to
say, pursuing what Gibbon calls "the exquisite rancour
of theological hatred". Its hostility to Joan of Arc and
the Reformation were alike intense. Richelieu built
the second Sorbonne, on the site of the present one.
The Revolution in its short sharp way put an end to it
as a defender of the faith, and in 1808, under Napoleon,
it sprang to life again with a broader and humaner
programme as the Université de France.</p>

<p>Although arriving on the wrong day (a very easy
thing to do in Paris) I induced the concierge to show
me Puvis de Chavannes' vast and beautiful fresco in the
Sorbonne's amphitheatre, entitled "La Source"&mdash;which
is, I take it, the spring of wisdom. Thursday is the
right day. In the chapel is the tomb of Richelieu, a
florid monument with the dying cardinal and some very
ostentatious grief upon it. Near by stands an elderly
gentleman who charges twice as much for postcards as
the dealers outside; but one must not mind that. The
church is not impressive, nor has a recent meretricious
work by Weerts, representing the Love of Humanity
and the Love of Country&mdash;the crucified Christ and a
dead soldier&mdash;done it much good. Before it is a monument
to Auguste Comte.</p>

<p>And now let us descend the hill and cheer and enrich
our eyes in one of the most remarkable museums in the
world&mdash;the Cluny. Paris is too fortunate. To have
the Louvre were enough for any city, but Paris also has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
the Carnavalet. To have the Carnavalet were enough,
but Paris also has the Cluny. The Musée de Cluny
is devoted chiefly to applied art, and is a treasury of
mediæval taste. It is an ancient building, standing on
the site of a Roman palace, the ruins of whose baths
still remain. The present mansion was built by a
Benedictine abbot in the fifteenth century: it became
a storehouse of beautiful and rare objects in 1833, when
the collector Alphonse du Sommerard bought it; and
on his death the nation acquired both the house and
its treasures, which have been steadily increasing ever
since. Without, the Cluny is a romantic blend of late
Gothic and Renaissance architecture: within, it is like
the heaven of a good arts-and-craftsman; or, to put it
another way, like an old curiosity shop carried out to the
highest power. I do not say that we have not as good
collections at South Kensington; but it is beyond doubt
that the Cluny has a more attractive setting for them.</p>

<p>To particularise would merely be to convert these
pages into an incomplete catalogue (and what is duller
than that?), but I may say that one passes among
sculpture and painting, altar-pieces and knockers, pottery
and tapestry, Spanish leather and lace, gold work and
glass, enamel and musical instruments, furniture (the
state bed of Francis I.) and ivories (note those by Van
Opstal), ironwork and jewels, fireplaces and exquisite
slippers. The old keys alone are worth hours: some of
them might almost be called jewels; be sure to look at
Nos. 6001 and 6022. Everything is remarkable. Writing
in London, in a thick fog, at some distance of time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
since I saw the Cluny last, I remember most vividly those
keys and a banc d'orfèvre near them; a chimney-piece,
beautiful and vast, from an old house at Châlons-sur-Marne;
certain carvings in wood in the great room next
the Thermes: the "Quatre Pleurants" of Claus de
Worde; a dainty Marie Madeleine by a Fleming, about
1500 (there is another Marie Madeleine, in stone, in an
adjacent room, kneeling with her alabaster box of ointment,
but by no means penitent); and the Jesus on the
Mount of Olives with the sleeping disciples. I remember
also, in one of the faience galleries, two delightful groups
by Clodion&mdash;a "Satyre mâle" with two baby goat-feet
playing by him, and a "Satyre femelle," very charming,
also with two little shaggy mites at her knees. The
"Fils de Rubens," in his little chair, is also a pleasant
memory; and there is one of those remarkable Neapolitan
reconstructions of the Nativity, of which the
museum at Munich has such an amazing collection&mdash;perhaps
the prettiest toys ever made.</p>

<p>But as I have said, the Cluny is wonderful throughout,
and it is almost ridiculous to particularise. It is
also too small for every taste. For the lover of the
hues that burn in Rhodian ware it is most memorable
for its pottery; while of the many Parisians who visit
it in holiday mood a large percentage make first for the
glass case that contains its two famous ceintures.</p>

<p>The Curator of the Carnavalet, as we have seen, is
a topographer and antiquary of distinction; the Director
of the Cluny, M. Haraucourt, is a poet, one of whose
ballads will be found in English form in a later chapter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
He is in a happy environment, although his Muse does
not look back quite as, say, Mr. Dobson's loves to do.
The singer of the "Pompadour's Fan" and the "Old
Sedan Chair" would be continually inspired at the Cluny.</p>

<p>In the Gardens of the Musée we can feel ourselves in
very early times; for the baths are the ruins of a Roman
palace built in 306, the home for a while of Julian the
Apostate; a temple of Mercury stood on the hill where
the Panthéon now is; and a Roman road ran on the
site of the Rue St. Jacques, just at the east of the Cluny,
leading out of Paris southwards to Italy.</p>

<p>On leaving the Cluny let us take a few steps westward
along the Rue de l'Ecole de Médicine, and stop at No.
15, where the Cordeliers' Club was held, whither Marat's
body was brought to lie in state. His house, in which
Charlotte Corday stabbed him, was close by, where the
statue of Broca now stands. In the Boulevard St.
Germain, at the end of the street, we come to Danton's
statue and more memories of the Revolution. "What
souvenirs of the past," says Sardou, "does the statue of
Danton cast his shadow upon. At No. 87 Boulevard
St. Germain&mdash;where the woman Simon keeps house! it
was there 31st March, 1793&mdash;at six o'clock in the morning,
the rattling of the butt ends of muskets was heard
on the pavement in the midst of wild cries and protestations
of the crowd, they had dared to arrest Danton,
the Titan of the Revolution, the man of the 10th of
August!&mdash;at the same time on the Place de l'Odéon,
at the corner of the Rue Crébillon, Camille Desmoulins
had been arrested. An hour later they were both in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
the Luxembourg prison, and it was there Camille heard
of the death of his mother.</p>

<p>"The Passage du Commerce still exists. It is a most
picturesque old quarter, rarely visited by Parisians. At
No. 9 is Durel's library, where Guillotin in 1790 practised
cutting off sheep's heads with 'his philanthropic beheading
machine'. It is generally given out that he was
guillotined himself, but 'Lemprière' says he died quietly
in his bed, of grief at the infamous abuse his instrument
was put to. In the shop close by was the printing
office of the <i>l'Ami du Peuple</i>, and Marat in his
dressing-gown (lined with imitation panther skin) used
to come and correct the proofs of his bloody journal."</p>

<p>Between the Cluny and the river is a network of
very old, squalid and interesting streets. Here the
students of the middle ages found both their schools
and their lodgings: among them Dante himself, who
refers to the Rue de Fouarre (or straw, on which, following
the instructions of Pope Urban V., the students sat)
as the Vico degli Strami. It has now been demolished.
The two churches here are worth a visit&mdash;St. Severin and
St. Julien-le-Pauvre, but the reader is warned that the
surroundings are not too agreeable. In the court adjoining
St Julien's are traces of the wall of Philip Augustus,
of which we saw something at the Mont de Piété.</p>

<p>All these streets, as I say, are picturesque and dirty,
but I think the best is the Rue de Bièvre, which runs
up the hill of St. Etienne from the Quai de Montebello,
opposite the Morgue, and can be gained from St. Julien's
by the dirty Rue de la Boucherie, of which this street
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
and its westward continuation, the Rue de la Huchette,
Huysmans, the French novelist and mystic, writes&mdash;as
of all this curious district&mdash;in his book, <i>La Bièvre et
Saint Severin</i>, one of the best examples of imaginative
topography that I know. Let us see what he says of
the Bièvre, the little river which gives the street its
name and which once tumbled down into the Seine at
this point, but is now buried underground like the New
River at Islington.</p>

<p>"The Bièvre," he writes, "represents to-day one of the
most perfect symbols of feminine misery exploited by a
big city. Originating in the lake or pond of St. Quentin
near Trappes, it runs quietly and slowly through the
valley that bears its name. Like many young girls from
the country, directly it arrives in Paris the Bièvre falls
a victim to the cunning wide-awake industry of a catcher
of men.... To follow all her windings, it is necessary to
ascend the Rue du Moulin des Prés and enter the Rue de
Gentilly, and then the most extraordinary and unsuspected
journey begins."</p>

<p>Inspired by the passage of which these are the opening
words, I set out one day to trace the Bièvre to daylight,
but it was a cheerless enterprise, for the Rue
Monge is a dreary street, and the new Boulevards hereabouts
are even drearier because they are wider. I
found her at last, by peeping through a hoarding in the
Boulevard Arago, with tanneries on each side of her;
and then I gave it up.</p>

<span class="s2"><i>(Louvre)</i></span></p></div>

<p>At the Cluny we saw the Thermes, a visible sign of
Roman occupation; just off the Rue Monge is another, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
amphitheatre, still in very good condition, with the grass
growing between the crevices of the great stone seats.
You will find it in the Place des Arènes, a vestige of
Roman manners and pleasures now converted into an
open space for children and <i>bonnes</i> and surrounded by
flats. But save for the desertion that the ages have
brought it, the arena is not so very different, and standing
there, one may easily reconstruct the spectators and
see again the wild beasts emerging from the underground
passages, which still remain.</p>

<p>And now for the Panthéon, which rises above us.

THE PANTHÉON AND ST. GENEVIÈVE</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>
<p class="blockquot">

Converts&mdash;<i>The Golden Legend</i>&mdash;A Sabbath-breaker&mdash;Geneviève's
Sacred Body&mdash;Her Tomb&mdash;The Panthéon Frescoes&mdash;Joan

<p>The Panthéon, like the Madeleine, has had its
vicissitudes. The new Madeleine, as we shall
see, was begun by Napoleon as a splendid Temple of
military glory and became a church; the new Panthéon
was begun by Louis XV. as a splendid cathedral and
became a Temple of Glory, not, however, military but
civil. Louis XV., when he designed its erection on the
site of the old church, intended it to be the church of
St. Geneviève, whose tomb was its proudest possession;
when the Revolution altered all that, it was made
secular and dedicated "aux grands hommes la patrie
reconnaissante," and the first grand homme to be buried
there was Mirabeau (destined, however, not to remain
a grand homme very long, as we shall see), and the next
Voltaire. In 1806 Napoleon made it a church again;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
in 1830 the Revolutionaries again secularised it; in
1851 it was consecrated again, and in 1885 once more
it became secular, to receive the body of Victor Hugo,
and secular it has remained; and considering everything,
secular it is likely to be, for whatever of change
and surprise the future holds for France, an excess of
ecclesiastical ecstasy is hardly probable.</p>

<p>So much of Louis XV.'s idea remains, in spite of the
perversion of his purpose, that scenes from the life of
St. Geneviève are painted on the Panthéon's walls and
sculptured on its façade; while in its last sacred days
the church was known again as St. Geneviève's. Possibly
there are old people in the neighbourhood who
still call it that. I hope so.</p>

<p>The life of St. Geneviève, as told in <i>The Golden
Legend</i>, is rather a series of facile miracles than a human
document, as we say. She was born in the fifth century
at Nanterre, and early became a protégée of St. Germain,
who vowed her to chastity and holiness, from
which she never departed. Her calling, like that of
her new companion on the canon, St. Joan, was that
of shepherdess, and one of Puvis de Chavannes' most
charming frescoes in the Panthéon represents her as a
shadowy slip of a girl kneeling to a crucifix while her
sheep graze about her. I reproduce it <a href="#chavannes">opposite the next
page</a>. Her mother, who had, like most mothers, a
desire that her daughter should marry and have children,
once so far lost her temper as to strike Geneviève
on the cheek; for which offence she became blind. (A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
very comfortable corner of heaven is, one feels, the due
of the mothers of saints.) She remained blind for a
long time, until remembering that St. Germain had
promised for her daughter miraculous gifts, she sent for
Geneviève and was magnanimously cured. After the
death of her parent, Geneviève moved to Paris, and there
she lived with an old woman, dividing the neighbourhood
into believers and unbelievers in her sanctity, as is ever
the way with saints. Here the Devil persecuted and
attacked her with much persistence and ingenuity, but
wholly without effect.</p>

<p>During her long life she made Paris her principal
home, and on more than one occasion saved it: hence
her importance not only to the Parisians, who set her
above St. Denis (whom she reverenced), but to this
book. Her power of prayer was gigantic; she literally
prayed Attila the Hun out of his siege of Paris,
and later, when Childeric was the besieger and Paris
was starving, she brought victuals into the city by boat
in a miraculous way: another scene chosen by Puvis de
Chavannes in his Panthéon series. Childeric, however,
conquered, in spite of Geneviève, but he treated her
with respect and made it easy for her to approach
Clovis and Clotilde and convert them to Christianity&mdash;hence
the convent of St. Geneviève, which Clovis founded,
remains of which are still to be seen by the church of St.
Etienne-du-Mont, in the two streets named after those
early Christians&mdash;the Rue Clovis and the Rue Clotilde.
Christianity had been introduced into Paris by Saint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
Denis, Geneviève's hero, in the third century; but then
came a reaction and the new faith lost ground. It was
St. Geneviève's conversion of Clovis that re-established
it on a much firmer basis, for he made it the national
religion.</p>

<p>"This holy maid," says Caxton, "did great penance
in tormenting her body all her life, and became lean
for to give good example. For sith she was of the age
of fifteen years, unto fifty, she fasted every day save
Sunday and Thursday. In her refection she had nothing
but barley bread, and sometime beans, the which,
sodden after fourteen days or three weeks, she ate for
all delices. Always she was in prayers in wakings and
in penances, she drank never wine ne other liquor, that
might make her drunk, in all her life. When she had
lived and used this life fifty years, the bishops that were
that time, saw and beheld that she was over feeble by
abstinence as for her age, and warned her to increase a
little her fare. The holy woman durst not gainsay
them, for our Lord saith of the prelates: Who heareth
you heareth me, and who despiseth you despiseth me,
and so she began by obedience to eat with her bread,
fish and milk, and how well that, she so did, she beheld
the heaven and wept, whereof it is to believe that she
saw appertly our Lord Jesus Christ after the promise of
the gospel that saith that, Blessed be they that be
clean of heart for they shall see God; she had her heart
and body pure and clean."</p>

<p>Caxton also tells quaintly the story of one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
first miracles performed by Geneviève's tomb: "Another
man came thither that gladly wrought on the
Sunday, wherefor our Lord punished him, for his hands
were so benumbed and lame that he might not work on
other days. He repented him and confessed his sin,
and came to the tomb of the said virgin, and there
honoured and prayed devoutly, and on the morn he
returned all whole, praising and thanking our Lord, that
by the worthy merits and prayers of the holy virgin,
grant and give us pardon, grace, and joy perdurable."</p>

<p>To St. Geneviève's tomb we shall come on leaving
the Panthéon, but here after so much about her adventures
when alive I might say something about her
adventures when dead. She was buried in 511 in the
Abbey church of the Holy Apostles, on the site of
which the Panthéon stands. Driven out by the Normans,
the monks removed the saint's body and carried it away
in a box; and thereafter her remains were destined to
rove, for when the monks returned to the Abbey they
did not again place them in the tomb but kept them in
a casket for use in processions whenever Paris was in
trouble and needed supernatural help. Meanwhile her
tomb, although empty, continued to work miracles also.</p>

<p>Early in the seventeenth century her bones were restored
to her tomb, which was made more splendid, and
there they remained until the Revolution. The Revolutionists,
having no use for saints, opened Geneviève's
tomb, burned its contents on the Place de Grève, and
melted the gold of the canopy into money. They also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
desecrated the church of St. Etienne-du-Mont (which
we are about to visit) and made it a Temple of Theophilanthropy.
A few years later the stone coffer was
removed to St. Etienne-du-Mont, where it now is, gorgeously
covered with Gothic splendours; but as to how
minute are the fragments of the saint that it contains
which must have been overlooked by the incendiary
Revolutionaries, I cannot say. They are sufficient, however,
still to cure the halt and the lame and enable them
to leave their crutches behind.</p>

<p>The Panthéon is a vast and dreary building, sadly in
need of a little music and incense to humanise it. The
frescoes are interesting&mdash;those of Puvis de Chavannes
in particular, although a trifle too wan&mdash;but one cannot
shake off depression and chill. The Joan of Arc paintings
by Lenepveu are the least satisfactory, the Maid
of this artist carrying no conviction with her. But
when it comes to that, it is difficult to say which of the
Parisian Maids of art is satisfactory: certainly not the
audacious golden Amazon of Frémiet in the Place de
Rivoli. Dubois' figure opposite St. Augustin's is more
earnest and spiritual, but it does not quite realise one's
wishes. I think that I like best the Joan in the
Boulevard Saint-Marcel, behind the Jardin des Plantes.</p>

<p>The vault of the Panthéon may be seen only in the
company of a guide, and there is a charge. To be quite
sure that Rousseau is in his grave is perhaps worth the
money; but one resents the fee none the less. Great
Frenchmen's graves&mdash;especially Victor Hugo's&mdash;should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
be free to all. There is no charge at the Invalides.
You may stand beside Heine's tomb in the Cimetière
de Montmartre without money and without a guide, but
not by Voltaire's in the Panthéon; Balzac's grave in
Père Lachaise is free, Zola's in the Panthéon costs
seventy-five centimes.</p>

<p>The guide hurries his flock from one vault to another,
at one point stopping for a while to exchange badinage
with an echo. Rousseau, as I have said, is here; Voltaire
is here; here are General Carnot, President Carnot
with a mass of faded wreaths, Soufflot&mdash;who designed
the Panthéon, thinking his work was for St. Geneviève,
and who died of anxiety owing to a subsidence of the
walls; Victor Hugo, and, lately moved hither, not without
turmoil and even pistol shots, the historian of the
Rougon-Macquart family and the author of a letter of
accusation famous in history.</p>

<p>Not without turmoil! which reminds one that the
Panthéon's funerals have been more than a little grotesque.
I said, for example, that Mirabeau was the first
prophet of reason to be buried here, amid a concourse
of four hundred thousand mourners; yet you may look
in vain for his tomb. And there is a record of the
funeral of Marat, in a car designed by David; yet you
may look in vain for Marat's sarcophagus also. The
explanation (once more) is that we are in France, the
land of the fickle mob. For within three years of
the state burial of Mirabeau, with the National Guard
on duty, the Convention directed that he should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
exhumed and Marat laid in his place. Mirabeau's body
therefore was removed at night and thrown into the
earth in the cemetery of Clamart. Enter Marat.
Marat, however, lay beneath this imposing dome only
three poor months, and then off went he, a discredited
corpse, to the graveyard of St. Etienne-du-Mont close
by. Voltaire, however, and Rousseau held their own,
and here they are still, as we have seen.</p>

<p>Voltaire came hither under circumstances at once
tragic and comic. The cortège started from the site of
the Bastille, led by the dead philosopher in a cart drawn
by twelve horses, in which his figure was being crowned
by a young girl. Opposite the Opera house of that
day&mdash;by the Porte St. Martin&mdash;a pause was made for
the singing of suitable hymns (from the Ferney Hymnal!)
and on it came again. Surrounding the car were fifty
girls dressed by David for the part; in the procession
were other damsels in the costumes of Voltaire's characters.
Children scattered roses before the horses.
What could be prettier for Voltaire? But it needed
fine weather, and instead came the most appalling storm,
which frightened all the young women (including Fame,
from the car) into doorways, and washed all the colour
from the great man's effigy.</p>

<p>Remembering all these things, one realises that Rodin's
<i>Penseur</i>, who was placed before the Panthéon in 1906,
has something to brood over and break his mind upon.</p>

<p>I noticed also among the graves that of one Ignace
Jacqueminot, and wondering if it were he who gave his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
name to the rose, I was so conscious of gloom and mortality
that I hastened to the regions of light&mdash;to the
sweet air of the Mont du Paris and the blue sky over
all. And later I climbed to the lantern&mdash;a trifle of
some four hundred steps&mdash;and looked down on Paris
and its river and away to the hills, and realised how
much better it was to be a live dog than a dead lion.</p>

<p>For the tomb of St. Geneviève we have only a few
steps to take, since it stands, containing all of her that was
not burned, in the church of St. Etienne-du-Mont. The
first martyr, although he gives his name to the church
and is seen suffering the stone-throwers in the relief
over the door, is, however, as nothing. St. Geneviève
is the true patron.</p>

<p>St. Etienne's is one of the most interesting churches
in Paris, without and within. The façade is bizarre and
attractive, with its jumble of styles, its lofty tower and
Renaissance trimmings, and the sacristan's prophet's-house
high up, on the northern side of the odd little
extinguisher. You see this best, and his tiny watchdog
trotting up and down his tiny garden, by descending
the hill a little way and then turning. Within, the
church is fascinating. The pillars of the very lofty nave
and aisles are slender and sure, the vaulting is delicate
and has a unique carved marble rood-loft to divide the
nave from the choir, stretching right along the church,
with a rampe of great beauty. The pulpit is held up
by Samson seated upon his lion and grasping the jawbone
of an ass.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<p>The last time I saw this pulpit was during the Fête
of St. Geneviève, which is held early in January, when
it contained a fluent nasal preacher to whom a congregation
that filled every seat was listening with rapt attention.
At the same time a moving procession of other
worshippers was steadily passing the tomb, which was a
blaze of light and heat from some hundreds of candles
of every size. The man in front of me in the queue, a
stout bourgeois, with his wife and two small daughters,
bought four candles at a franc each. He was all nervousness
and anxiety before then, but having watched
them lighted and placed in position, his face became
tranquil and gay, and they passed quickly out, re-entered
their motor-cab and returned to the normal life.</p>

<p>Outside the church was a row of stalls wholly given
up to the sale of tokens of the saint&mdash;little biographies,
medals, rosaries, and all the other pretty apparatus of
the long-memoried Roman Catholic Church. I bought
a silver pendant, a brief biography, and a tiny metal
statue. I feel now that had I also bought a candle, as
I was minded to, I should have escaped the cold that,
developing two or three days later, kept me in bed for
nearly a fortnight. One must be thorough.</p>

<p>The church not only has agreeable architectural
features and the tomb of this good woman, it has also
some admirable glass, not exactly beautiful but very
quaint and interesting, including a famous window by the
Pinaigriers, representing the mystery of the wine-press,
as drawn from Isaiah: "I have trodden the wine-press
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
alone, and of the people there was none with me".
The colouring is very rich and satisfying, even if the
design itself offends by its literalism and want of imagination&mdash;Christianity
being figured by the blood of
Christ as it gushes forth into barrels pressed from his
body as relentlessly as ever was juice of the grape. All
this is horrible, but one need not study it minutely.
There are other windows less remarkable but not less
rich and glowing.</p>

<p>Other illustrious dust that lies beneath this church
is that of Racine and Pascal.

<p>On the day of one of my visits to the Jardin des
Plantes I lunched at the Tour d'Argent, a
restaurant on the Quai de la Tournelle, famous among
many dishes for its delicious canard à la presse. No
bird on this occasion passed through that luxurious
mill for me: but the engines were at work all around
distilling essential duck with which to enrich those
slices from the breast that are all that the epicure eats.
Over a simpler repast I studied a bewildering catalogue
of the "Créations of Frédéric"&mdash;Frédéric being M.
Frédéric Delair, a venerable chef with a head like
that of a culinary Ibsen, stored with strange lore of
sauces.</p>

<p>By what means one commends oneself to Frédéric
I cannot say, but certain it is that if he loves you he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
will immortalise you in a dish. Americans would seem
to have a short cut to his heart, for I find the Canapé
Clarence Mackay, the Filet de Sole Loië Fuller, the
Filet de Sole Gibbs, the Fondu de Merlan Peploe, the
Poulet de Madame J. W. Mackay, and the Poire Wanamaker.
None of these joys tempted me, but I am sorry
now that I did not partake of the Potage Georges Cain,
because M. Georges Cain knows more about old Paris
than any man living; and who knows but that a few
spoonfuls of his Potage might not have immensely
enriched this book! The Noisette de Pré-Salé Bodley
again should have been nourishing, for Mr. Bodley is
the author of one of the best of all the many studies of
France. Instead, however, I ate very simply, of ordinary
dishes&mdash;foundlings, so to speak, named after no one&mdash;and
amused myself over my coffee in examining the
Marquis Lauzières de Thémines' poésie sur les Créations
de Frédéric (to the air of "la Corde Sensible"). Two
stanzas and two choruses will illustrate the noble poet's
range:&mdash;</p>

<p>On the way to the Jardin des Plantes from this
restaurant it is not unamusing to turn aside to the
Halles des Vins and loiter a while in these genial catacombs.
Here you may see barrels as the sands of the
sea-shore for multitude, and raw wine of a colour that
never yet astonished in a bottle, and I hope, so far as
I am concerned, never will: unearthly aniline juices
that are to pass through many dark processes before
they emerge smilingly as vins, to lend cheerfulness to
the windows of the épicier and gaiety to the French
heart.</p>

<p>Even with the most elementary knowledge of French
one would take the Jardin des Plantes to be the Parisian
Kew, and so to some small extent it is; but ninety-nine per
cent. of its visitors go not to see the flora but the fauna.
It is in reality the Zoo of the Paris proletariat. Paris,
unlike London, has two Zoos, both of which hide
beneath names that easily conceal their zoological
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
character from the foreigner&mdash;the Jardin des Plantes,
where we now find ourselves, which is free to all,
and the Jardin d'Acclimatation, on the edge of the Bois
de Boulogne, near the Porte Maillot, which costs money&mdash;a
franc to enter and a ridiculous supplément to your
cabman for the privilege of passing the fortifications in
his vehicle: one of Paris's little mistakes. To the
Jardin d'Acclimatation we shall come anon: just now
let us loiter among the wild animals of the Jardin des
Plantes, which is as a matter of fact a far more thorough
Zoo than that selecter other, where frivolity ranks before
zoology. Our own Zoo contains a finer collection than
either, and our animals are better housed and ordered,
but this Parisian people's Zoo has a great advantage
over ours in that it is free. All zoological gardens
should of course be free.</p>

<p>The Jardin des Plantes has another and a dazzling
superiority in the matter of peacocks. I never saw so
many. They occur wonderfully in the most unexpected
places, not only in the enclosures of all the other open-air
animals, but in trees and on roofs and amid the bushes&mdash;burning
with their deep and lustrous blue. But on
the warm day of spring on which I saw them first they
were not so quiescent. Regardless of the proprieties they
were most of them engaged in recommending themselves
to the notice of their ladies. On all sides were spreading
tails bearing down upon the beloved with the steady
determination of a three-masted schooner, and now and
then caught like that vessel in a shattering breeze (of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
emotion) which stirred every sail. In England one might
feel uncomfortable in the midst of so naked a display of
the old Adam, but in Paris one becomes more reconciled
to facts, and (like the new cat in the adage) ceases
to allow "I am ashamed" to wait upon "I would".
The peahens, however, behaved with a stolid circumspection
that was beyond praise. These vestals never lifted
their heads from the ground, but pecked on and on,
mistresses of the scene and incidentally the best friends
of the crowds of ouvriers and ouvrières ("V'là le paon!
Vite! Vite!") at every railing. But the Parisian peacock
is not easily daunted. In spite of these rebuffs the
batteries of glorious eyes continued firing, and wider
and wider the tails spread, with a corresponding increase
of disreputable déshabillé behind; and so I left them,
recalling as I walked away a comic occurrence at school
too many years ago, when a travelling elocutionist, who
had induced our headmaster to allow him to recite to the
boys, was noticed to be discharging all his guns of tragedy
and humour (some of which I remember distinctly at
the moment) with a broadside effect that, while it
assisted the ear, had a limiting influence on gesture and
by-play, and completely eliminated many of the nuances
of conversational give and take. Never throughout the
evening did we lose sight of the full expanse of his shirt
front; never did he turn round. Never, do I say?
But I am wrong. Better for him had it been never:
for the poor fellow, his task over and his badly needed
guinea earned, forgot under our salvoes of applause the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
need of caution, and turning from one side of the platform
to the other in stooping acknowledgment, disclosed
a rent precisely where no man would have a rent to
be.</p>

<p>My advice to the visitor to the Jardin des Plantes is
to be satisfied with the living animals&mdash;with the seals
and sea-lions, the bears and peacocks, the storks and
tigers; and, in fair weather, with the flowers, although
the conditions under which these are to be observed are
not ideal, so formally arranged on the flat as they are,
with traffic so visibly adjacent. But to the glutton for
museums such advice is idle. Here, however, even he
is like to have his fill.</p>

<p>Let him then ask at the Administration for a ticket,
which will be handed to him with the most charming smile
by an official who is probably of all the bureaucrats of
Paris the least deserving of a tip, since zoological and
botanical gardens exist for the people, and these tickets
(the need for which is, by the way, non-existent) are
free and are never withheld&mdash;but who is also of all the
bureaucrats of Paris the most determined to get one,
even, as I observed, from his own countrymen. Thus
supplied you must walk some quarter of a mile to a huge
building in which are collected all the creatures of the
earth in their skins as God made them, but lifeless and
staring from the hands of taxidermic man. It is as
though the ark had been overwhelmed by some such
fine dust as fell from Vesuvius, and was now exhumed.
One does not get the same effect from the Natural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
History Museum in the Cromwell Road; it is, I suppose,
the massing that does it here.</p>

<p>Having walked several furlongs amid this travesty of
wild and dangerous life, one passes to the next museum,
which is devoted to mineralogy and botany, and here
again are endless avenues of joy for the muséephile and
tedium for others. Lastly, after another quarter of a
mile's walk, the palatial museum of anatomy is reached,
the ingenious art of the late M. Frémiet once more
providing a hors d'&oelig;uvre. At the Arts Décoratifs we
find on the threshold a man dragging a bear cub into
captivity; at the Petit Palais, St. George is killing the
dragon just inside the turnstile; and here, near the
umbrella-stand, is a man being strangled by an orang-outang.
Thus cheered, we enter, and are at once amid
a very grove of babies in bottles: babies unready for the
world, babies with two heads, babies with no heads at all,
babies, in short, without any merit save for the biologist,
the distiller, and the sightseer with strong nerves.
From the babies we pass to cases containing examples
of every organ of the human form divine, and such
approximations as have been accomplished by elephants
and mice and monkeys&mdash;all either genuine, in
spirits, or counterfeited with horrible minuteness in wax.
Also there are skeletons of every known creature, from
whales to frogs, and I noticed a case illustrating the
daily progress of the chicken in the egg.</p>

<p>And now for the other Zoo, the Zoo of the classes.
Perhaps the best description is to call it a playground
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
with animals in it. For there are children everywhere,
and everything is done for their amusement&mdash;as is only
natural in a land where children persist through life
and no one ever tires. In the centre of the gardens is
an enclosure in which in the summer of 1908 were
encamped a colony of Gallas, an intelligent and attractive
black people from the border of Abyssinia, who
flung spears at a target, and fought duels, and danced
dances of joy and sorrow, and rounded up zebras, and in
the intervals sold curiosities and photographs of themselves
with ingratiating tenacity. It was a strange
bizarre entertainment, with greedy ostriches darting
their beaks among the spectators, and these shock-headed
savages screaming through their diversions, and
now and again a refined slip of a black girl imploring
one mutely to give a franc for a five centimes picture
postcard, or murmuring incoherent rhapsodies over the
texture of a European dress.</p>

<p>All around the enclosure the Parisian children were
playing, some riding elephants, others camels, some
driving an ostrich cart, and all happy. But the gem of
the Jardin is the Ecurie, on one side for ponies&mdash;scores
of little ponies, all named&mdash;the other for horses; on
one side a riding school for children, on the other
side a riding school for grown-up pupils, perhaps
the cavalry officers of the future. The ponies are
charming: Bibiche, landaise, Volubilité, cheval landais,
Céramon, cheval finlandais, Farceur, from the same
country, Columbine, née de Ratibor, and so forth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
There they wait, alert and patient too, in the manner
of small ponies, and by-and-by one is led off to the
Petit manège for a little Monsieur Paul or Etienne to
bestride. The Ecurie is a model of its kind, with its
central courtyard and offices for the various servants,
sellier, piqueur and so forth.</p>

<p>Near by is a castellated fortress which might belong
to a dwarf of blood but is really a rabbit house. Every
kind of rabbit is here, with this difference from the
rabbit house in our Zoo, that the animals are for sale;
and there is a fragrant vacherie where you may learn
to milk; and in another part is a collection of dogs&mdash;tou-tous
and lou-lous and all the rest of it&mdash;and these
are for sale too. This is as popular a department as
any in the Jardin. The expressions of delight and
even ecstasy which were being uttered before some of
the cages I seem still to hear.</p>

<p>The Parisians may be kind fathers and devoted
mothers: I am sure that they are; but to the observer
in the streets and restaurants their finest shades of
protective affection would seem to be reserved for dogs.
One sees their children with bonnes; their dogs are
their own care. The ibis of Egypt is hardly more
sacred. An English friend who has lived in the heart
of Paris for some time in the company of a fox terrier
tells me that on their walks abroad in the evening the
number of strangers who stop him to pass friendly
remarks upon his pet or ask to be allowed to pat it&mdash;or
who make overtures to it without permission&mdash;is beyond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
belief. No pink baby in Kensington Gardens is more
admired. Dogs in English restaurants are a rarity:
but in Paris they are so much a matter of course that
a little pâtée is always ready for them.</p>

<p>It was of course a French tongue that first gave utterance
to the sentiment, "The more I see of men the
more I like dogs"; but I cannot pretend to have observed
that the Frenchman suffers any loss in prestige
or power from this attention to the tou-tou and the lou-lou.
Nothing, I believe, will ever diminish the confidence
or success of that lord of creation. He may to the insular
eye be too conscious of his charms; he may suggest
the boudoir rather than the field of battle or the field of
sport; he may amuse by his hat, astonish by his beard,
and perplex by his boots; but the fact remains that he is
master of Paris, and Paris is the centre of civilisation.</p>

<p>The Parisians not only adore their dogs in life: they
give them very honourable burial. We have in London,
by Lancaster Gate, a tiny cemetery for these friendly
creatures; but that is nothing as compared with the
cemetery at St. Ouen, on an island in the Seine. Here
are monuments of the most elaborate description, and
fresh wreaths everywhere. The most striking tomb is
that of a Saint Bernard who saved forty persons but
was killed by the forty-first&mdash;a hero of whose history
one would like to know more, but the gate-keeper is
curiously uninstructed.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span></p>

<p>I walked among these myriad graves, all very recent
in date, and was not a little touched by the affection
that had gone to their making. I noted a few names:
Petit Bob, Espérance (whose portrait is in bas-relief
accompanied by that of its master), Peggie, Fan, Pincke,
Manon, Dick, Siko, Léonette (aged 17 years and 4
months), Toby, Kiki, Ben-Ben ("toujours gai, fidèle et
caressant"&mdash;what an epitaph to strive for!), Javotte,
Nana, Lili, Dedjaz, Trinquefort, Teddy and Prince
(whose mausoleum is superb), Fifi (who saved lives),
Colette, Dash (a spaniel, with a little bronze sparrow
perching on his tomb), Boy, Bizon (who saved his owner's
life and therefore has this souvenir), and Mosque ("regretté
et fidèle ami"). There must be hundreds and
hundreds altogether, and it will not be long before
another "Dog's Acre" is required.</p>

<p>Standing amid all the little graves I felt that the one
thing I wanted to see was a dog's funeral. For surely
there must be impressive obsequies as a preparation to
such thoughtful burial. But I did not. No melancholy
cortège came that way that afternoon; Fido's pompes
funèbres are still a mystery to me.</p>

<p>But to my mind the best dogs in Paris are not such
toy pets as for the most part are here kept in sacred
memory, but those eager pointers that one sees on
Sunday morning at the Gare du Nord, and indeed at all
the big stations, following brisk, plump sportsmen with
all the opéra bouffe insignia of the chase&mdash;the leggings
and the belt and the great satchel and the gun. For
the Frenchman who is going to shoot likes the world
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
to know what a lucky devil he is: he has none of our
furtive English unwillingness to be known for what we
are. I have seen them start, and I have waited about
in the station towards dinner time just to see them
return, with their bags bulging, and their steps springing
with the pride and elation of success, and the faithful
pointers trotting behind.</p>

<p>Everything is happy at the Jardins des Plantes
and d'Acclimatation to-day: but it was not always so.
During a critical period of 1870 and 1871 the cages
were in a state of panic over the regular arrival of the
butcher&mdash;not to bring food but to make it. Mr. Labouchere,
the "Besieged Resident," writing on December
5th, 1870, says: "Almost all the animals in the Jardin
d'Acclimatation have been eaten. They have averaged
about 7 f. a lb. Kangaroo has been sold for 12 f. the lb.
Yesterday I dined with the correspondent of a London
paper. He had managed to get a large piece of mufflon,
and nothing else, an animal which is, I believe, only
found in Corsica. I can only describe it by saying that
it tasted of mufflon, and nothing else. Without being
absolutely bad, I do not think that I shall take up my
residence in Corsica, in order habitually to feed upon it."</p>

<p>On December 18th Mr. Labouchere was at Voisin's.
The bill of fare, he says, was ass, horse and English
wolf from the Zoological Gardens. According to a
Scotch friend, the English wolf was Scotch fox. Mr.
Labouchere could not manage it and fell back on the
patient ass. Voisin's, by the way, was the only restaurant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
which never failed to supply its patrons with a
meal. If you ask Paul, the head waiter, he will give
you one of the siege menus as a souvenir.</p>

<p>Mr. Labouchere's description of typical life during
the siege may be quoted here as offering material for
reflection as we loiter about this city so notable to-day
for pleasure and plenty. "Here is my day. In the
morning the boots comes to call me. He announces
the number of deaths which have taken place in the
hotel during the night. If there are many he is
pleased, as he considers it creditable to the establishment.
He then relieves his feelings by shaking his fist in the
direction of Versailles, and exits growling 'Canaille de
Bismarck'. I get up. I have breakfast&mdash;horse, <i>café au
lait</i>&mdash;the <i>lait</i> chalk and water&mdash;the portion of horse
about two square inches of the noble quadruped. Then
I buy a dozen newspapers, and after having read them
discover that they contain nothing new. This brings
me to about eleven o'clock. Friends drop in, or I drop
in on friends. We discuss how long it is to last&mdash;if
friends are French we agree that we are sublime. At
one o'clock get into the circular railroad, and go to one
or other of the city gates. After a discussion with the
National Guards on duty, pass through. Potter about
for a couple of hours at the outposts; try with glass to
make out Prussians; look at bombs bursting; creep
along the trenches; and wade knee-deep in mud through
the fields. The Prussians, who have grown of late malevolent
even towards civilians, occasionally send a ball far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
over one's head. They always fire too high. French
soldiers are generally cooking food. They are anxious
for news, and know nothing about what is going on.
As a rule they relate the episode of some <i>combat
d'avant-poste</i> which took place the day before. The
episodes never vary. 5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>&mdash;Get back home; talk to
doctors about interesting surgical operations; then drop
in upon some official to interview him about what he is
doing. Official usually first mysterious, then communicative,
not to say loquacious, and abuses most people
except himself. 7 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>&mdash;Dinner at a restaurant; conversation
general; almost every one in uniform. Still
the old subjects&mdash;How long will it last? Why does
not Gambetta write more clearly? How sublime we
are; what a fool every one else is. Food scanty, but
peculiar.... After dinner, potter on the Boulevards
under the dispiriting gloom of petroleum; go home and
read a book. 12 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>&mdash;Bed. They nail up the coffins
in the room just over mine every night, and the tap,
tap, tap, as they drive in the nails, is the pleasing music
which lulls me to sleep."</p>

<p>Here is another extract illustrating the pass to which
a hungry city had come: "Until the weather set in so
bitter cold, elderly sportsmen, who did not care to stalk
the human game outside, were to be seen from morning
to night pursuing the exciting sport of gudgeon fishing
along the banks of the Seine. Each one was always
surrounded by a crowd deeply interested in the chase.
Whenever a fish was hooked, there was as much excitement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
as when a whale is harpooned in more northern
latitudes. The fisherman would play it for some five
minutes, and then, in the midst of the solemn silence of
the lookers-on, the precious capture would be landed.
Once safe on the bank, the happy possessor would be
patted on the back, and there would be cries of 'Bravo!'
The times being out of joint for fishing in the Seine,
the disciples of Izaak Walton have fallen back on the
sewers. The <i>Paris Journal</i> gives them the following
directions how to pursue their new game: 'Take a
long strong line, and a large hook, bait with tallow, and
gently agitate the rod. In a few minutes a rat will come
and smell the savoury morsel. It will be some time
before he decides to swallow it, for his nature is cunning.
When he does, leave him five minutes to meditate over it;
then pull strongly and steadily. He will make convulsive
jumps; but be calm, and do not let his excitement gain
on you, draw him up, <i>et voilà votre dîner</i>.'"</p>

<p>There is still hardly less excitement when a fish is
landed by a quai fisherman, but the emotion is now
purely artistic.

<p>The Madeleine has had a curious history. The
great Napoleon built it, on the site of a small
eighteenth-century church, as a Temple of Glory, a gift
to his soldiers, where every year on the anniversaries of
Austerlitz and Jena a concert was to be held, odes read,
and orations delivered on the duties and privileges of
the warrior, any mention of the Emperor's own name
being expressly forbidden. That was in 1806. The
building was still in progress when 1815 came, with another
and more momentous battle in it, and Napoleon
and his proposal disappeared. The building of the
Temple of Glory was continued as a church, and a church
it still is; and the memory of Jena and Austerlitz is
kept alive in Paris by other means (they have, for
example, each a bridge), no official orations are delivered
on the soldier's calling, no official odes recited. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
a noble idea of the Emperor's, and however perfunctorily
carried out, could not have left one with a less satisfied
feeling than some of the present ceremonials in the
Madeleine, which has become the most fashionable Paris
church. Napoleon, however, is not wholly forgotten, for
in the apse, I understand, is a fresco representing Christ
reviewing the chief champions of Christianity and felicitating
with them upon their services, the great Emperor
being by no means absent. Herr Baedeker says
that the fresco is there, but I have not succeeded in
seeing it, for the church is lit only by three small
cupolas and is dark with religious dusk.</p>

<p>Within, the Madeleine is a surprise, for it does not
conform to its fine outward design. One expects a
classic severity and simplicity, and instead it is paint and
Italianate curves. The wisest course for the visitor is
to avoid the steps and the importunate mendicants at
the railings, and slip in by the little portal on the west
side where the discreet closed carriages wait.</p>

<p>Louis XVIII., with his passion&mdash;a very natural one&mdash;to
obliterate Napoleon and the revolutionaries and
resume monarchical continuity, wished to complete the
Madeleine as a monument to Louis XVI. and Marie
Antoinette; but he did not persevere with the idea.
He built instead, on the site of the old cemetery of the
Madeleine, where Louis XVI. and the Queen had been
buried, the Chapelle Expiatoire. It is their memory
only which is preserved here, for, after Waterloo, their
bones were carried to St. Denis, where the other French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
kings lie. Their statues, however, are enshrined in the
building (which is just off the Boulevard Haussmann,
isolated solemnly and impressively among chestnut trees
and playing children), the king being solaced by an
angel who remarks to him in the words used by Father
Edgeworth on the scaffold, "Fils de St. Louis, montez
au ciel!" and the queen by religion, personified by
her sister-in-law, Madame Elizabeth. The door-keeper,
who conducted me as guide, was in raptures over Louis
XVI.'s lace and the circumstance that he was hewn
from a single block of marble. I liked his enthusiasm:
these unfortunate monarchs deserve the utmost that
sculptor and door-keeper can give them.</p>

<p>Paris has changed its mind more completely and
frequently than any city in the world&mdash;and no illustration
of that foible is better than this before us. Consider
the sequence: first the king; then the prisoner;
then the execution&mdash;the body and head being carried
to the nearest cemetery, the Madeleine, where the
guillotine's victims were naturally flung, and carelessly
buried. Ten months later the queen's body and head
follow. (It is said that the records of the Madeleine
contain an entry by a sexton, which runs in English,
"Paid seven francs for a coffin for the Widow Capet".)
That was in 1793. Not until 1815 do they find sepulture
befitting them, and then this chapel rises in their
honour and they become saints.</p>

<span class="s2">(<i>Louvre</i>)</span></p></div>

<p>Among other bodies buried here was that of Charlotte
Corday. Also the Swiss Guards, whom we saw meeting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
death at the Tuileries. A strange place, and to-day,
in a Paris that cares nothing for Capets, a perfect
example of what might paradoxically be called well-kept
neglect.</p>

<p>To me the Madeleine has always a spurious air:
nothing in it seems quite true. Externally, its Roman
proportions carry no hint of the Christian religion;
within, there is a noticeable lack of reverence. Every
one walks about, and the Suisses are of the world
peculiarly and offensively worldly. Standing before the
altar with its representation of the Magdalen, who gives
the church its name, being carried to Heaven, it is difficult
to realise that only thirty-eight years ago this very
spot was running red with the blood of massacred Communards.</p>

<p>I remember the Madeleine most naturally as I saw
it once at Mi-Carême, from an upper window at Durand's,
after lunch. It was a dull day and the Madeleine
frowned on the human sea beneath it; for the
Place before it and the Rue Royale were black with
people. The portico is always impressive, but I had
never before had so much time or such excellent opportunity
to study it and its relief of the Last Judgment,
an improbable contingency to which few of us were
giving much thought just then. Not only were the
steps crowded, but two men had climbed to the green
roof and were sitting on the very apex of the building.</p>

<p>The Mi-Carême carnival in Paris, I may say at once,
is not worth crossing the Channel for. It is tawdry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
and stupid; the life of the city is dislocated; the
Grands Boulevards are quickly some inches deep in
confetti, all of which has been discharged into faces and
even eyes before reaching the ground; the air is full of
dust; and the places of amusement are uncomfortably
crowded. The Lutetian humours of the Latin Quarter
students and of Montmartre are not without interest for
a short time, but they become tedious with extraordinary
swiftness and certainty as the morning grows grey.</p>

<p>Each side of the Madeleine has its flower markets,
and they share the week between them. Round and
about Christmas a forest of fir-trees springs up. At
the back of the Madeleine omnibuses and trams converge
as at the Elephant.</p>

<p>For a walk along the Grands Boulevards this temple
is the best starting-point; but I do not suggest that
the whole round shall be made. By the Grands Boulevards
the precisian would mean the half circle from the
Madeleine to the Place de la République and thence
to the Place de la Bastille; or even the whole circle,
crossing the river by the Pont Sully to the Boulevard
St. Antoine, which cuts right through the Surrey side
and crosses the river by the Pont de la Concorde and
so comes to the Rue Royale and the Madeleine again.
Those are the Grands Boulevards; but when the term
is conversationally used it means nothing whatever but
the stretch of broad road and pavement, of vivid kiosques
and green branches, between the Madeleine and the Rue
Richelieu: that is the Grands Boulevards for the flâneur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
and the foreigner. All the best cafés to sit at, all the
prettiest women to stare at, all the most entertaining
shop windows, are found between these points.</p>

<p>The prettiest women to stare at! Here I touch on
a weakness in the life of Paris which there is no doubt
the Boulevards have fostered. Staring&mdash;more than
staring, a cool cynical appraisement&mdash;is one of the
privileges which the Boulevardier most prizes. I have
heard it said that he carries staring to a fine art; but
it is not an art at all, and certainly not fine; it is just
a coarse and disgusting liberty. It is nothing to him
that the object of his interest is accompanied by a man;
his code ignores that detail; he is out to see and to
make an impression and nothing will stop him. One
must not, however, let this ugly practice offend one's
sensibility too much. Foreigners need not necessarily
do as the Romans do, but it is not their right to be too
critical of Rome; and liberty is the very air of the
Boulevards. Live and let live. If one is going to be
annoyed by Paris, one had better stay at home.</p>

<p>The Grands Boulevards might be called the show-rooms
of Paris: it is here that one sees the Parisians.
In London one may live for years and never see a
Londoner; not because Londoners do not exist, but
because London has no show-rooms for their display.
There is no Boulevard in London; the only streets that
have a pavement capable of accommodating both spectators
and a real procession of types are deserted, such
as Portland Place and Kingsway. The English, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
conquer and administer the world, dislike space; the
French, a people at whose alleged want of inches we
used to mock, rejoice in space. Think of the Champs-Elysées
and the Bois, and then think of Constitution
Hill and Hyde Park, and you realise the difference.
Take a mental drive by any of the principal Boulevards&mdash;from
the Madeleine eastward to the Place de la
République and back to the Madeleine again by way
of the Boulevards de Magenta and Clichy and down the
Boulevard Malesherbes, and then take a mental drive
from Hyde Park Corner by way of Piccadilly, the
Strand, Fleet Street, Cannon Street, Lombard Street,
Cheapside, Holborn, Oxford Street and Park Lane to
Hyde Park Corner again and you realise the difference.
In wet weather in Paris it is possible to walk all day and
not be splashed. Think of our most fashionable thoroughfare,
just by Long's Hotel, when it is raining&mdash;our Rue
de la Paix. The only street in London of which a
Frenchman would not be ashamed is the Mile End Road.</p>

<p>At the Taverne Olympia&mdash;just past the old houses
standing back from the pavement, on the left, which
are built on the wall of the old moat, when this Boulevard
really was a bulwark or fortification&mdash;at the Taverne
Olympia, upstairs, is one of the few billiard saloons in
Paris in which exhibition games are continually in
progress, and in which one can fill many amusing half-hours
and perhaps win a few louis. Years ago I used
to frequent the saloon in a basement under the Grand
Café, a few doors east of the Olympia, but it has lost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
some of its prestige. The best play now is at Olympia
and at Cure's place in the Rue Vivienne. Every day of
the year, for ever and ever, a billiard match is in progress.
So you may say is, in the winter, the case in
London at Burroughs and Watts', or Thurston's, but
these are very different. In London the match is for a
large number of points and it may last a week or a fortnight.
Here there are scores of matches every afternoon
and evening and the price of admission is a consommation.
By virtue of one glass of coffee you may sit for
hours and watch champion of France after champion of
France lose and win, win and lose.</p>

<p>The usual game is played by three champions of
France and is for ten cannons off the red. The names
of the players, on cards, are first flung on the table, and
the amateur of sport advances from his seat and stakes
five francs on that champion of France whom he favours.
Five francs is the unit. On my first visit, years ago,
the champion whom I, very unsoundly but not perhaps
unnaturally, supported, was one Lucas. Poor fellow,
on that afternoon he did his best, but he never got
home. The great Marius was too much for him.
Marius in those days was a very fine player and the
hero of the saloon at the Grand Café. A Southerner
I should guess; for I have seen his doubles by the score
in the cafés of Avignon and Nîmes. He was short and
thick, with a bald head and a large sagacious nose and a
saturnine smile and a heavy moustache. Winning and
losing were all one to him, although it is understood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
that fifty centimes are contributed by each of his backers
to a champion of France when he brings it off. Marius
looked down his nose in the same way whatever happened.
He was no Roberts; he had none of the
Cæsarian masterfulness, none of the Napoleonic decision,
of that king of men. The modern French game does not
lend itself to such commanding excellence, such Alpine
distinction. The cannon is all: there is no longer any
of the quiet and magical disappearance of the ball into
a pocket which makes the English game so fascinating.</p>

<p>Such was Marius when I first saw him, and quite lately
I descended to his cellar again and found him unaltered,
except that he was no longer a master except very occasionally,
and that he had grown more sardonic. I do
not wonder at it. It may not be, in Paris, "a lonely
thing to be champion," as Cashel Byron says, but it
must be a melancholy thing to be no longer the champion
that you were. A home of rest for ex-champions would
draw my guinea at once.</p>

<p>The ten or eight cannons off the red, I might add,
are varied now and then. Sometimes there is a match
between two players for a hundred points. Sometimes
three players will see which can first make eight cannons,
each involving three cushions (trois bandes). This is
a very interesting game to watch, although it may be
a concession to decadence.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="center s2">PANTHÉON</span><br />
THE RUE DE BIÈVRE<br />
<span class="s2">(FROM THE QUAI DE MONTEBELLO)</span></p></div>

<p>We come next to the Rue Scribe, and crossing it,
are at "Old England," a shop where the homesick may
buy such a peculiarly English delicacy as marmalade,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
beneath the shadow of the gigantic Grand Hotel,
notable not only for its million bedrooms but for marking
the position of one of the few post offices of Paris,
and also the only shop in the centre of the city which
keeps a large and civilised stock of Havana cigars. One
can live without Havana cigars, but post offices are
a necessity, and in Paris they conceal themselves with
great success; while, as for letter-boxes, it has been
described as a city without one. To a Londoner accustomed
to the frequent and vivid occurrence at street
corners of our scarlet obelisks, it is so. Quite recently
I heard of a young Englishman, shy and incorrigibly
one-languaged, who, during a week in Paris, entrusted
all his correspondence to a fire-alarm. But, as a matter
of fact, Paris has letter-boxes in great number, only for
the most part they are so concealed as to be solely for the
initiated. Directly one learns that every tobacconist also
sells stamps and either secretes a letter-box somewhere
beneath his window, or marks the propinquity of one,
life becomes simple.</p>

<p>Although normally one never has, in France, even in
the official receptacle of one of the chief of the Bureaux
des Postes, any of that confidence that one reposes in
the smallest wall-box in England; yet one must perforce
overcome this distrust or use only pneumatiques. The
French do not carry ordinary letters very well, but
if you register them nothing can keep the postman
from you. A knock like thunder crashes into your
dreams, and behold he is at your bedside, alert and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
important, be-ribboned with red tape, tendering for your
signature a pen dipped in an inkstand concealed about
his person. Every one who goes to France for amusement
should arrange to receive one registered letter.</p>

<p>Its letter-boxes may be a trifle farcical, but in its
facilities given to purchasers of stamps France makes
England look an uncivilised country. Why it should
be illegal for any one but a postal official to supply
stamps in my own land, I have never been informed,
nor have any of the objections to the system ever been
explained away. In France you may get your stamps
anywhere&mdash;from tobacconists for certain; from waiters
for certain; from the newspaper kiosques for certain;
and from all tradespeople almost for certain: hence one
is relieved of the tiresome delays in post offices that are
incident to English life. But I am inclined to think
that when it comes to the post office proper, England
has the advantage. The French post office (when you
have found it) is always crowded and always overheated;
and you remember what I told the men in the Mint.</p>

<p>To return to the Grand Hotel, I am minded to express
the wish that something could be done to rid its
pavement of the sly leering detrimental with an umbrella
who comes up to the foreigner and offers his services as a
guide to the night side of Paris. Not until an Englishman
has killed one of these pests will this part of Paris
be endurable. But from what I have observed I should
say that few murders are less likely to occur....</p>

<p>And so we come to the Café de la Paix, and turning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
to the left, the Opera is before us. The Opera is one
of the buildings of Paris that are taken for granted.
We do not look at it much: we think of it as occupying
the central position, adjacent to Cook's, useful as
a place of meeting; we buy a seat there occasionally,
and that is all. And yet it is the largest theatre in
the world (the work of that Charles Garnier whose
statue is just outside), and although it is not exactly
beautiful, its proportions are agreeable; it does not
obtrude its size (and yet it covers three acres); it sits
very comfortably on the ground, and an incredible
amount of patient labour and thought went to its
achievement, as any one may see by walking round it
and studying the ornamentation and the statuary,
among which is Carpeaux's famous lively group "La
Danse". One very pleasant characteristic of the Opera
is the modesty with which it announces its performances:
nothing but a minute poster in a frame, three or
four times repeated, giving the information to the passer-by.
Larger posters would impair its superb reserve.</p>

<p>The Opera has a little museum, the entrance to which
is in the Rue Auber corner, by the statue of the architect
(with his plan of the building traced in bronze
below his bust). This museum is a model of its kind&mdash;small
but very pertinent and personal in character.
Here are one of Paganini's bows and his rosin box;
souvenirs of Malibran presented to her by some Venetian
admirers in 1835; Berlioz' season ticket for the Opera
in 1838, and a page of one of his scores; Rossini in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
a marble statuette, asleep on his sofa, wearing that
variety of whisker which we call a Newgate fringe;
Rossini on his death-bed, drawn by L. Roux, and a page
of a score and a cup and saucer used by him; a match
box of Gounod's, a page of a score, and his marble bust;
Meyerbeer on his death-bed, drawn by Mousseaux, a
decoration worn by that composer, and a page of his
score; two of Cherubini's tobacco boxes and a page of
his score; Danton's clay caricature of Liszt&mdash;all hair
and legs&mdash;at the piano, and a caricature of Liszt playing
the piano while Lablache sings and Habeneck conducts;
a bust of Fanny Cerrito, danseuse, in 1821&mdash;with a
mischievous pretty face&mdash;that Cerrito of whom Thomas
Ingoldsby rhymed; and a bust of Emma Livry, a danseuse
of a later day, who died aged twenty-three from injuries
received from fire during the répétition génerale of
the "Muette de Portici" on November 15th, 1862. In
a little coffer near by are the remains of the clothes the
poor creature was wearing at the time. What else is
there? Many busts, among them Delibes the composer
of "Coppélia," whose grave we shall see in the Cimetière
de Montmartre: here bearded and immortal; autograph
scores by Verdi, Donizetti, Victor Massé, Auber, Spontini
(whose very early piano also is here), and Hérold; a
caricature by Isabey of young Vestris bounding in mid-air,
models of scenes of famous operas, and a host of
other things all displayed easily in a small but
sufficient room. If all museums were as compact and
single-minded!

A CHAIR AT THE CAFÉ DE LA PAIX</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span></p>
<p class="blockquot">
The Green Hour&mdash;In the Stalls of Life&mdash;National Contrasts and the
Futility of Drawing Them&mdash;The Concierge&mdash;The Bénéfice Hunters&mdash;The
Claque&mdash;The Paris Theatre&mdash;The Paris Music Hall&mdash;The

City of Waiters&mdash;Ridicule&mdash;Women&mdash;Cabmen&mdash;The Levelling
of the Tourist&mdash;French Intelligence&mdash;The Chauffeurs&mdash;The Paris
Spectacle.</p>

<p>And now since it is the "green hour"&mdash;since it is
five o'clock&mdash;let us take a chair outside the Café
de la Paix and watch the people pass, and meditate,
here, in the centre of the civilised world, on this wonderful
city of Paris and this wonderful country of France.</p>

<p>I am not sure but that when all is said it is not these
outdoor café chairs of Paris that give it its highest charm
and divide it from London with the greatest emphasis.
There are three reasons why one cannot sit out in this
way in London: the city is too dirty; the air is rarely
warm enough; and the pavements are too narrow. But
in Paris, which enjoys the steadier climate of a continent
and understands the æsthetic uses of a pavement, and
burns wood, charcoal or anthracite, it is, when dry,
always possible; and I, for one, rejoice in the privilege.
This "green hour"&mdash;this quiet recess between five and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
six in which to sip an apéritif, and talk, and watch the
world, and anticipate a good dinner&mdash;is as characteristically
French as the absence of it is characteristically English.
The English can sip their beverages too, but how different
is the bar at which they stand from the comfortable
stalls (so to speak) in the open-air theatres of the Boulevards
in which the French take their ease.</p>

<p>At every turn one is reminded that these people live
as if the happiness of this life were the only important
thing; while if we subtract a frivolous fringe, it may
be said of the English that (without any noticeable gain
in such advantages as spirituality confers) they are always
preparing to be happy but have not yet enough money
or are not yet quite ready to begin. The Frenchman
is happy now: the Englishman will be happy to-morrow.
(That is, at home; yet I have seen Englishmen in Paris
gathering honey while they might, with both hands.)</p>

<p>But the French and English, London and Paris, are
not really to be compared. London and Paris indeed
are different in almost every respect, as the capitals of
two totally and almost inimically different nations must
be. For a few days the Englishman is apt to think that
Paris has all the advantages: but that is because he is
on a holiday; he soon comes to realise that London is
his home, London knows his needs and supplies them.
Much as I delight in Paris I would make almost any
sacrifice rather than be forced to live there; yet so long
as inclination is one's only master how pleasant are her
vivacity and charm. But comparisons between nations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
are idle. For a Frenchman there is no country like
France and no city like Paris; for an Englishman England
is the best country and London the most desirable
city. For a short holiday for an Englishman, Paris is a
little paradise; for a short holiday for a Frenchman,
London is a little inferno.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="head" id="head"></a>

<p class="caption">GIRL&#39;S HEAD<br />
<span class="s2">ÉCOLE DE FABRIANO</span><br />
<span class="s2">(<i>Louvre</i>)</span></p></div>

<p>Each country is the best; each country has advantages
over the other, each country has limitations. The
French may have wide streets and spacious vistas, but
their matches are costly and won't light; the English,
even in the heart of London, may be contented with
narrow and muddy and congested lanes, but their sugar
at least is sweet.</p>

<p>The French may have abolished bookmakers from
their race-courses and may give even a cabman a clean
napkin to his meals, but their tobacco is a monopoly.
The English may fill their streets with newspaper posters
advertising horrors and scandals, but they are permitted
now and then to forget their vile bodies. The French
may piously and prettily erect statues of every illustrious
child of the State, but their billiard tables are
now without pockets. London may have a cleaner Tube
railway system than Paris, but Paris has the advantage
of no lifts and a correspondence ticket at a trifling cost
which will take you everywhere, whereas London's Tubes
belonging to different companies the correspondence is
expensive. Again with omnibuses, London may have
more and better, but here again the useful correspondence
system is to be found only in Paris.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span></p>

<p>London may be in darkness for most of the winter
and be rained upon by soot all the year round; but at
any rate the Londoner is master in his own house or
flat and not the cringing victim of a concierge, as every
Parisian is. That is something to remember and be
thankful for. Paris has an atmosphere, and a climate,
and good food, and attentive waiters, and a cab to every
six yards of the kerb, and no petty licensing tyrannies, and
the Champs-Elysées, and immunity from lurid newspaper
posters, and good coffee, and the Winged Victory, and
Monna Lisa; but it also has the concierge. At the entrance
to every house is this inquisitive censorious janitor&mdash;a
blend in human shape of Cerberus and the Recording
Angel. The concierge knows the time you go out
and (more serious) the time you come in; what letters
and parcels you receive; what visitors, and how long
they stay. The concierge knows how much rent you
pay and what you eat and drink. And the worst of it
is that since the concierge keeps the door and dominates
the house you must put a good face on it or you will
lose very heavily. Scowl at the concierge and your life
will become a harassment: letters will be lost; parcels
will be delayed; visitors will be told you are at home;
a thousand little vexations will occur. The concierge
in short is a rod which, you will observe, it is well to kiss.
The wise Parisian therefore is always amiable, and generous
too, although in his heart he wishes the whole system
at the devil.</p>

<p>And here I ought to say that although one is thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
conscious of certain of the defects and virtues of each
nation, I have no belief whatever in any large interchange
of characteristics being possible. Nations I
think can borrow very little from each other. What
is sauce for the goose is by no means necessarily sauce
for the oie, and the meat of an homme can easily be the
poison of a man.</p>

<p>The French and the English base life on such different
premises. To put the case in a nutshell, we may
say that the French welcome facts and the English avoid
them. The French make the most of facts; the English
persuade themselves that facts are not there. The
French write books and plays about facts, and read and
go to the theatre to see facts; the English write books
and plays about sentimental unreality, and read and go
to the theatre in order to be diverted from facts. The
French live quietly and resignedly at home among facts;
the English exhaust themselves in games and travel and
frivolity and social inquisitiveness, in order to forget that
they have facts in their midst.</p>

<p>One always used to think that the English were the
most willing endurers of impositions and monopolies;
but I have come to the conclusion that a people that
can continue to burn French matches and use French
ink and blotting-paper, bend before the concierge and
suffer the claque and the French theatre attendant,
must be even weaker. Only a people in love with
slavery would continue to endure the black bombazined
harpies who turn the French theatres into infernos, first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
by their very presence and secondly by their clamour
for a bénéfice. They do nothing and they levy a tax
on it. So far from exterminating them, this absurd
lenient French people has even allowed them to dominate
the cinematoscope halls which are now so numerous
all over Paris. I sit and watch them and wonder what
they do all day: in what dark corner of the city they
hang like bats till the evening arrives and they are
free to poison the air of the theatres and exact their
iniquitous secret commission. The habit of London
managers to charge sixpence for a programme&mdash;an
advertisement of his wares such as every decent and
courteous tradesman is proud to give away&mdash;is sufficiently
monstrous; but I can never enough honour them
for excluding these bénéfice hunters.</p>

<p>Whatever may be said of French acting and French
plays there is no doubt that our theatres are more comfortable
and better managed. A Frenchman visiting a
theatre in London has no difficulties: he buys his seat
at the office, is shown to it and the matter ends. An
Englishman visiting a theatre in Paris has no such ease.
He must first buy his ticket (and let him scrutinise the
change with some care and despatch); this ticket, however,
does not, as in London, carry the number of his
seat: it is merely a card of introduction to the three
gentlemen in evening dress and tall hats who sit side by
side in a kind of pulpit in the lobby. One of them
takes his ticket, another consults a plan and writes a
number on it, and the third hands it back. Another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
difficulty has yet to come, for now begins the turn of
the harpies. Why the English custom is not followed,
and a clean sweep made of both the men in the pulpit
and the women inside, one has no notion; for in addition
to being a nuisance they must reduce the profits.</p>

<p>I mentioned the claque just now. That is another
of the Frenchman's darling bugbears which the English
would never stand. Every Frenchman to whom I have
spoken about it shares my view that it is an abomination,
but when I ask why it is not abolished he merely
shrugs his shoulders: "Why should it be?&mdash;one can
endure it," is the attitude; and that indeed is the
Frenchman's attitude to most of the things that he finds
objectionable. They are, after all, only trimmings;
the real fabric of his life is not injured by them; therefore
let them go on. Yet while one can understand the
persistence of certain Parisian defects, the long life of
the claque remains a mystery. Upon me the periodical
and mechanical explosions of this body of hirelings have
an effect little short of infuriation. One is told that
the actors are responsible rather than the managers, and
this makes its continuance the more unreasonable, for
the result has been that in their efforts to acquire the
illusion of applause, they have lost the real thing.
French audiences rarely clap any more.</p>

<p>When it comes to the consideration of the French
stage, there is again no point in making comparisons.
It is again a conflict of fact and sentiment. The
French are intensely interested in the manifestations of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
the sexual emotion, and they have no objection to see
the calamities and embarrassments and humours to which
it may lead worked out frankly on the boards or in
literature: hence a certain sameness in their plays and
novels. The majority of the English still think that
physical matters should be hidden: hence our dramatists
and novelists having had to find other themes, adventure,
eccentricity and character have won their predominant
place. That is all there is to it. The French stage is
the best&mdash;to a Frenchman or a gallicised Englishman;
the English stage is the best&mdash;to the English. The
English go rather to see; the French to hear. In other
words a blind Frenchman would be better pleased with
his national stage than a blind Englishman with his.
The blind Frenchman would at any rate not miss the
jokes, which, though he knew them all before, he could
not resist; whereas the Englishman would be deprived
of the visible touches of which the personæ of our drama
are largely built up. In a drama of passion, whether
treated seriously or lightly, words necessarily are more
than idiosyncrasies.</p>

<p>In the Paris music halls the comic singers merely
sing&mdash;they have little but words to give. London
music hall audiences may have an undue affection for
red noses and sordid domestic details; but they do
expect a little character, even if it is coarse character,
during the evening, and they get it. There is little in
the French hall. Personality is discouraged here; richness,
quaintness, unction, irresponsibility, eccentricity&mdash;such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
gifts as once pleased us in Dan Leno and now are
to be found in a lesser degree but very agreeably in
Wilkie Bard&mdash;these are superfluities to a French comic
singer. All that is asked of him is that he shall be
active, shall have a resonant voice, and shall commit to
memory a sufficient number of cynical reflections on life.
A gramophone producing any rapid indecent song would
please the French more than a hundred Harry Lauders.
(And yet when all is said it must be far easier to live in a
country where decency, as we understand and painfully
cultivate it, has not everywhere to be considered. The
life at any rate of the French author, publisher, editor and
magistrate, to name no others, is immensely simplified.)</p>

<p>But from my point of view the worst characteristic
of the French music hall and variety stage is the revue.
The revue is indeed a standing proof of the incontrovertible
fact that however the hotel proprietors may
feel about it, the Parisian does not want English people
in his midst. (Why should he?) The revue in its
quiddity is a device for excluding foreigners from
theatres; for it is not only dull and monotonous, but
being for the most part a satire on Parisian politics is
incomprehensible too. I am not here to defend the
English pantomime, but not all its agonies (as Ruskin
called them) reach such a height of tedium as a revue
can achieve. A Frenchman ignorant of English at
Drury Lane on Boxing Night might be bewildered and
even stunned; but he would at any rate know something
of what was happening and his eyes would be kept busy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
An Englishman at a revue knows nothing, for there is
no story, and very little money is spent on the stage
picture: it is just a steady cataract of topical talk. I
have endured many revues, always hoping against hope
that some one would be witty or funny, that some ingenious
satirical device would occur. But I have never
been rewarded. No matter what the nominal subject,
the jokes have been the same: the old old mots à
double entente, the old old outspoken indecency....</p>

<p>The stream of people continues to be incessant and
of incredible density&mdash;all walking at the same pace, all
talking as only the French can talk, rich and poor
equally owners of the pavement. Now and then a
camelot offers a toy or a picture postcard; boys bring
<i>La Patrie</i> or <i>La Presse</i>; a performer bends and twists
a piece of felt into every shape of hat, culminating in
Napoleon's famous chapeau à cornes....</p>

<p>One thing that one notices is the absence of laughter.
The French laugh aloud very seldom. Even in their
theatres, at the richest French jokes, their approval is
expressed rather in a rippling murmur counterfeiting
surprise than a laugh. Animation one sees, but on
these Boulevards behind that is often a suggestion of
anxiety. The dominant type of face seen from a chair
at the Café de la Paix is not a happy one....</p>

<p>It is when one watches this restless moving crowd, or
the complacent audiences at the farces, or the diners in
restaurants eating as if it were the last meal, and when
one looks week after week at the comic papers of Paris,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
with their deadly insistence on the one and apparently
only concern of Parisian life, that one has most of all to
remind oneself that these people are not the French, and
that one is a superficial tourist in danger of acquiring
very wrong impressions. This is the fringe, the froth.
One has only to remember a very few of the things we
have seen in Paris to realise the truth of this. Never
was a harder working people. Look at the early hours
that Paris keeps: contrast them with London's slovenly
awakening. Look at the amazing productivity of a
notoriously idle and careless set&mdash;the artists: the old
Salon with its miles of pictures twice a year, and the
other Salons, hardly less crowded, and the minor exhibitions
too. Look at the industry of the Paris stage:
the new plays that are produced every week, involving
endless rehearsals day and night. Look at the energy
of the French authors, dramatic as well as narrative, of
the journalists and printers. Think of the engineers,
the motor-car manufacturers, the gardeners and the
vintners. Think of the bottle-makers. (But one cannot:
such a thought causes the head to reel in this city
of bottles.) No, we are not seeing France, we foreign
visitors to "the gay capital". Don't let us labour
under any such mistake. The industrious, level-headed,
cheerful French people do not exhibit themselves to the
scrutinising eyes of the Café de la Paix, do not spend
all their time as <i>Le Rire</i> would have us believe, do not
over eat and over drink.</p>

<p>Around and about one all the time, as one watches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
this panorama, the swift and capable waiters are busy.
Every one carries away from Paris one mastering impression
upon the inward eye: I am not sure that
mine is not a blur of waiters in their long white aprons.
At the Paris Exhibition of 1900, over the principal
entrance at the south-west corner of the Place de la
Concorde, was the gigantic figure of a young and
fashionable woman in the very heyday of her vivacity,
allurement and smartness. She personified Paris. But
not so would I symbolise that city. In any coat of arms of
Paris that I designed would certainly be a capable young
woman, but also a waiter, sleek, attentive and sympathetic.</p>

<p>Paris may be a city of feminine charm and domination;
but to the ordinary foreigner, and especially the Englishman,
it is far more a city of waiters. Women we
have in England too: but waiters we have not. There
are waiters in London, no doubt, but that is the end of
them: there are, to all intents and purposes, no waiters
in the provinces, where we eat exclusively in our own
houses. And even in London we must brace ourselves
to find such waiters as there are: we must indulge in
heroic feats of patience, and, once the waiter comes into
view, exercise most of the vocal organs to attract his
notice and obtain his suffrages. In other words, there
is in London perhaps one waiter to every five thousand
persons; whereas in Paris there are five thousand
waiters, more or less, to every one person. Or so it
seems. It is a city of waiters; it is <i>the</i> city of waiters.</p>

<p>Still the people stream by, and one wonders whence
the idea comes that the French are a particularly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
small race. It is not true. Look at that tall boulevardier
with some one else's hat (why do so many Frenchmen
seem to be wearing other men's hats?) and the
immense beard. Look at those two long-haired artists
from the Latin Quarter, in velvet clothes and black
sombreros. In England they would be stared at and
laughed at; but here no one is laughed at at all, and
only the women are stared at. It is interesting to
note how little street ridicule there is in France. The
Frenchman mocks, but he does not, as I think so many
of the English do, search for the ridiculous; or at any
rate it is not the same kind of ridiculousness that we
pillory. In England we bring such sandpaper of prejudice
and public opinion to bear upon eccentricity that
every one becomes smooth and ordinary&mdash;like every one
else. But in France&mdash;to the superficial observer, at
any rate&mdash;individuality is encouraged and nourished;
in France either no one is ridiculous or every one is.</p>

<p>Some one once remarked to me that never in Paris
do you see a woman with any touch of the woods. It
is true. The Parisian women suggest the boudoir, the
theatre, the salon, the sewing-room, the kitchen, and
now and then even the fields; but never the woods....</p>

<p>One misses also in Paris the boy of from fifteen to
eighteen. Younger boys there are, and young men
abound, but youths of that age one does not much see,
and very rarely indeed a father and son together. In
fact the generations seem to mix very little: in the
restaurants men of the same age are usually together:
beards lunch with beards....
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

<p>And the road is dense too. There is a block every
few minutes, while the agents in the centre of the
carrefour do their best to control the four streams of
traffic. It is odd that a people with so much sense of
order and red tape should fail so signally to produce an
organiser of traffic. Certain it is that the stupidest
Kentish giant who joins the Metropolitan police force
has a better idea of such a duty than any of these
polished gentlemen in caps. Partly perhaps because in
London the police are feared and obeyed, and in Paris
the drivers, particularly the cabmen, care for no one.
The words Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité are not stencilled
all over our churches and public buildings, you see.</p>

<p>The cabmen! My impression now is, writing here in
England, that the Paris cochers are all exactly alike.
They have white hats and blue coats and bad horses
and black moustaches, and their backs entirely fill the
landscape. They beat their horses and shout at them
all the time. One seldom sees an accident, although
they never look as if they were going to avoid one.
That is partly because they are a weary and cynical
folk, and partly because in France the roads belong to
vehicles, and not, as in England, to foot-passengers. In
England if you are run over, you can prosecute the
driver and get damages; in France if you are run over,
the driver (one has always heard) can prosecute you for
being in the way.</p>

<p class="caption">THE BOULEVARD DES ITALIENS<br />
<span class="s2">(LOOKING EAST)</span></p></div>

<p>No matter with what fervour is the entente fostered
and nourished, the Parisian cabman will see to it that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
the hatchet is never too deeply interred, that the racial
excrescences are not too smoothly planed. Polite hotel
managers, obsequious restaurateurs, smiling sommeliers
and irradiated shopkeepers may do their best to assure
the Anglo-Saxon that he is among a people that exist
merely to do him honour and adore his personality; but
directly he hails a cab he knows better. The truth is
then his. Not that the Parisian cocher hates a foreigner.
Nothing so crude as that. He merely is possessed by a
devil of contempt that prompts him to humiliate and
confound us. To begin with he will not appear to want
you as a fare; he will make it a favour to drive you at
all. He will then begin his policy of humorous pin-pricks.
Though you speak with the accent of Mounet-Sully
himself he will force you to pronounce the name
of your destination not once but many times, and then
very likely he will drive you somewhere else first. You
may step into his cab with a feeling that Paris is becoming
a native city: you will emerge wishing it at the bottom
of the sea. That is the cocher's special mission in life&mdash;subtly
and insidiously to humiliate the tourist. He does
it like an artist and as an artist&mdash;for his own pleasure.
It is the only compensation that his dreary life carries.</p>

<p>The French, I fancy, are not less capable of stupidity
than any other people. There is an idea current that
they are the most intelligent of races, but I believe this
to be a fallacy, proceeding from the fact that the French
language lends itself to epigrammatic expression, and
that every French child dips his cup into the common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
reservoir of engaging idioms and adroit phrases.
This means that French conversation, even among the
humblest, is better than English conversation under
similar and far more favourable conditions; but it means
no more. It gives no real intelligence. The incapacity
of the ordinary Frenchman to get enough imagination
into his ear (so fine that it can distinguish between the
most delicate vowel sounds in his own language) to enable
it to understand a foreign pronunciation is partly a
proof of this. But take him at any time off his regular
lines, present a new idea to him, and he can be as stupid
as a Sussex farm labourer. It is the same with America.
Just as the French language imposes wit on its user, so is
every American, man or woman, fitted at birth with the
mechanism of humour. Yet how few are humorous!</p>

<p>But the cocher is not the only cabman of Paris:
there remains the driver of the auto. The motor cab
has not elbowed out the horse cab in Paris as it has in
London, nor probably will it, for the Parisians are not
in a hurry; but for Longchamp and such excursions
the auto is indispensable, and the motor cabman becomes
more and more a characteristic of the streets. Our
London chauffeurs are sufficiently implacable, blunt
and churlish, but the Parisian chauffeur is like fate.
There is no escape if you enter his car: he lights
his cigarette, sinks his back into his seat, and his
shoulders into his back, and his head into his shoulders,
and drives like the devil. He seems to have no life of
his own at all: he exists merely to urge his car wherever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
he is told. The foreigner has no hold whatever upon
the chauffeur; he arranges the meter to whatever tariff
he pleases, and before you can examine the dial at the end
of the journey he has jerked up the flag. When you
keep him waiting his meter devours your substance. Always
terrible, he is worst in winter, when he is dressed
entirely in hearth-rugs. The old cocher for me.</p>

<p>But it grows chilly and it is dinner time. Let us go.
Yet first I would remind you that we chose the Café de
la Paix for our reverie only because it is the centre, and
we were intent upon the centre. But the pavement
chairs of all the cafés of Paris are interesting, and it is
equally good to sit in any populous bourgeois quarter
where one can watch the daily indigenous life of this city,
which the visitor who remains for the most part in the
visitors' districts can so easily miss. The busy, capable
girls and women shopping&mdash;their pretty uncovered heads
all so neatly and deftly arranged, and their bags and
baskets in their hands; the chair mender blowing his
horn; the teams of white horses, six or eight in single
file, with high collars and bells, drawing blocks of stone
or barrels of wine; the tondeur de chiens, with his
mournful pipe and box of scissors; the brisk errand boys;
the neat little milliners with their band-boxes; now and
then a slovenly soldier and a well-groomed erect agent.
Paris as a spectacle is perpetually new and amusing.

The Christmas Baraques&mdash;The Rue de la Chaussée d'Antin&mdash;The Rue

Roar of Finance&mdash;Tailors as Cartoonists&mdash;A Bee-hive Street&mdash;Cities

Martin's Act of Charity&mdash;The Arts et Métiers; a Modern Cluny&mdash;Statues
of the Republic.</p>

<p>From the Place de l'Opéra to the Place de la République
is an interesting and instructive walk,
but at no time of the day a very easy one; and between
five o'clock and half-past six, and eight and ten, on the
north pavement, it is always almost a struggle; but when
the baraques are in full swing around Christmas and the
New Year, it is a struggle in earnest, at any rate as far
as the Rue Drouot. Indeed Christmas and New Year,
but especially Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve, are
great times in France, and presents are exchanged as
furiously as with us.</p>

<p>On Christmas Eve&mdash;Réveillon as it is called&mdash;no one
would do anything so banal as to go to bed. The restaurants
obtain a special permission to remain open,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
and tables are reserved months in advance. Montmartre,
never very sleepy, takes on a double share of wakefulness.</p>

<p>The first street on our left, the Rue de la Chaussée
d'Antin, is one of the busiest in Paris, with excellent
shops and many interesting associations. Madame
Récamier lived at No. 7, the site of the Hôtel d'Antin.
So also did Madame Necker and Madame Roland, and
for a while Edward Gibbon. Chopin lived at No. 5.
This street, by the way, has suffered almost more than
any other from the Parisian fickleness in nomenclature.
It began as the Rue de la Chaussée Gaillon, then Rue
de l'Hôtel Dieu, then Rue de la Chaussée d'Antin, from
Richelieu's Hôtel d'Antin, then the Rue Mirabeau, from
the revolutionary who lodged and died at No. 42, then,
when Mirabeau's body was removed ignominiously from
the Panthéon, the Rue Mont Blanc, and in 1815 it
became once again the Rue de la Chaussée d'Antin.</p>

<p>At the foot of the Rue Laffitte one should stop, because
one gets there a glimpse of Montmartre's white
and oriental cathedral, hanging in mid-air, high above
Paris and the church of Notre Dame de Lorette. This
street is, to me, one of the most entertaining in the city,
for almost every other shop is a picture-dealer's, and to
loaf along it, on either side, is practically to visit a gallery.
Two or three of these shops keep as a continual
sign the words "Bronzes de Barye". The Rue Laffitte
was named after the banker Jacques Laffitte, whose bank
was in the Rue de la Chaussée d'Antin. Cerutti, who
delivered Mirabeau's funeral oration, set up his revolutionary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
journal <i>La Feuille Villageoise</i> here. At the
Hôtel Thelusson at the end of the street the Incroyables
and the Merveilleuses assembled. Among the guests
was General Buonaparte, and it was here that he first
met Joséphine Beauharnais.</p>

<p>The Musée Grévin, to which we soon come on the
left, is the Parisian Tussaud's; and it is as much better
than Tussaud's as one would expect it to be. Tussaud's
is vast and brilliant; the Musée Grévin is small and
mysterious. There is so little light that every one seems
wax, and one has to look very narrowly and anxiously
at all motionless figures. The particular boast of the
Grévin is its groups: not so much the Pope and his
pontifical cortège, the coulisses of the Opera (a scene of
coryphées and men about town), and the Fête d'Artistes,
as the admirable tableaux of the Revolution. To the untutored
eye of one who, like myself, avoids waxworks,
the Grévin figures and grouping are good and, what is
perhaps more important, intelligent. Pains have been
taken to make costumes and accessories historically accurate,
and in many cases the actual articles have been
employed, notably in the largest tableau of all&mdash;"Une
Soirée à Malmaison"&mdash;which was arranged under the
supervision of Frédéric Masson, the historian, an effigy
of whom stands near by. Among these scenes the historical
sense of the French child can be really quickened.
There are also tableaux of Rome in the time of the early
Christians&mdash;very clever and painful.</p>

<p>At the Rue Drouot, at the conjunction of the Boulevards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
des Italiens and de Montmartre, there is an angle.
Hitherto we have been walking west by north; we now
shall walk west by south. From this point we shall also
observe a difference in the character of the street, which
will become steadily more bourgeois. At this corner,
where the traffic is always so congested, owing largely
to the omnibuses with the three white horses abreast
that cross to and from the Rue Richelieu, all the best
cafés are behind us.</p>

<p>If that £32,000,000 reconstruction scheme of which
I have already spoken comes to pass, this point will be
unrecognisable, for among the items in that programme
is the uniting of the Boulevard Haussmann, which now
comes to an abrupt end at the Rue Taitbout, with the
Boulevard de Montmartre, which, as a glance at the
map will show, is in a line with it. But my hope is that
the improvement will be long deferred.</p>

<p>It is in the Rue Richelieu that the Bibliothèque
Nationale stands, where the foreign resident in Paris
may read every day, precisely as at the British Museum,
provided always that he is certified by his Consul to be
worthy of a ticket, and the visitor may on certain days
examine priceless books and autographs, prints and maps
and cameos and wonderful antiquities. Here once lived
Cardinal Mazarin, and it is in the galerie that bears his
name that the rarest bindings are to be seen&mdash;some from
Grolier's own shelves. Among the MSS. is that of
Pascal's <i>Pensées</i>. The library, which is now perhaps
the finest in existence, has been built up steadily by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
kings of France, even from Charlemagne, but Louis
XII. was the first of them who may really be called a
bibliophile, to be worthily followed by François I. It
was not until 1724, in the reign of Louis XV., that the
royal collection was removed to this building. The
Revolution greatly added to its wealth by transferring
hither the libraries of the destroyed convents and monasteries.
The treasures in the Cabinet de Médailles
I cannot describe; all I can say is that they ought not
to be missed. They may be called an extension of the
Galerie d'Apollon in the Louvre.</p>

<p>Before leaving the Bibliothèque I should add that in
certain of its rooms, with an entrance in the Rue Vivienne,
exhibitions are periodically held, and it is worth while to
ascertain if one is in progress. In the spring of 1908 I saw
there a most satisfying display of Rembrandt's etchings.</p>

<p>It was in one of the old book-shops in the neighbourhood
of the Bibliothèque that I received my first
impression of the Paris Bourse. I was turning over
little pocket editions of Voltaire's <i>Pucelle</i> and naughty
Crébillons and such ancient boudoir fare, when I began
to be conscious of a sound as of a thousand boys' schools
in deadly rivalry. On hurrying out to learn the cause
I found Paris in its usual condition of self-containment
and intent progress; no one showed any sign of inquisitiveness
or excitement; but on the steps of the Bourse
I observed a shouting, gesticulating mob of men who
must, I thought, be planning a new Reign of Terror.
But no; they were merely financiers engaged in the

ordinary work of life. The Bourse is free, and I climbed
the steps, pushed through the money-makers, and entered.
Never again. I have seen men engaged in the unlovely
task of acquiring lucre by more or less improper means
in various countries, but I never saw anything so horrible
as the rapacity expressed upon the faces of this heated
Bourse populace.</p>

<p>Capel Court is not indifferent to the advantages of a
successful coup, but Capel Court differs from the Bourse
not only in a comparative retention of its head, but also
in a certain superficial appearance of careless aristocracy.
Capel Court dresses well and keeps time for a practical
joke now and then. The Bourse is shabby and in the
grip of avarice. Wall Street and the Chicago pit, I am
told, are worse: I have not seen them; but no race-course
scramble for odds could exceed the horrors of that day
in the Bourse. The home, by the way, of this daily vociferous
service of Mammon, was built on the site of the
old convent of the Filles de St. Thomas. During the
Revolution the connection between the Bourse and
Heaven was even closer, for the church of the Petits
Pères was then set apart for Exchange purposes.</p>

<p>Returning to the point where we left the Boulevard&mdash;at
the Rue Richelieu&mdash;I am moved to ask what would
happen in London if Messrs. Baker in the Tottenham
Court Road or Messrs. Gardiner in Knightsbridge were
suddenly to break out into caricature and embellish their
windows with scarifying cartoons of Kings, Kaisers, Presidents
and Premiers? The question may sound odd,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
but it is simple enough if you visit the High Life tailor
at the corner of the Rue Richelieu, or, farther east, a
similar establishment at the corner of the Rue de Rougemont,
for it then becomes obvious that it is quite part
of the duties of the large Parisian clothier to do his part
in forming public opinion. These cartoons are always
bold and clever, although often too municipal for the
foreigner's apprehension.</p>

<p>I have said somewhere that one of my favourite streets
in Paris is the Rue Montorgeuil. That is largely, as
I have explained, because it is old and narrow, and the
people swarm in it, and the stalls are so many, and the
houses are high and white and take the sun so bravely,
and it smells of Paris; and also, of course, because the
Compas d'Or is here, bringing the middle ages so nigh.
Another favourite is the Rue du Faubourg Montmartre
(which is now the next on the left eastward) for
its busy happy shops and its moving multitudes. In its
own narrow way it is almost as crowded as the Grands
Boulevards.</p>

<p>A little way up this street, on the right, is a gateway
leading into a very curious backwater, as noticeably quiet
as the highways are noisy and restless: the Cité Bergère,
the largest of those cités within a cité of which Paris has
several, to be compared in London only with St. Helen's
Place in Bishopsgate or Park Row at Knightsbridge. The
Cité Bergère is practically nothing but hotels&mdash;high and
narrow, with dirty white walls and dirty green shutters&mdash;very
cheap, and very incurious as to the occupations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
of their guests, whether male or female. It has a gate
at each end which is closed at night and penetrated
thereafter only at the goodwill of the concierge, whom
it is well to placate. The Cité Bergère leads into the
Cité Rougemont (hence offering an opportunity to an
innkeeper between the two to hang out the imposing
sign of the Hôtel des Deux Cités), and from the Cité
Rougemont you gain that district of Paris where the
woollen merchants congregate.</p>

<p>Returning to the Grands Boulevards, the next street
on the left is the Rue Rougemont, and if we take this
we come in a few moments to the Conservatoire, where
so many famous musicians have been taught, and where
Coquelin and Sarah Bernhardt learned the art of elocution.
There is a little museum at the Conservatoire in
which every variety of musical instrument is preserved,
together with a few personal relics, such as a cast of
Paganini's nervous magical hand, with its long sharply
pointed fingers, and the death-mask of Chopin.</p>

<p>Close to the Conservatoire is the darkest church in
Paris&mdash;Saint Eugène, a favourite spot for funeral services.
I chanced once to stay in a room overlooking
this church, until the smell of mortality became too
constant. There was a funeral every day: every morning
the undertakers' men were busy in the preparations
for the ceremony&mdash;draping the façade with heavy curtains
of a blackness that seemed to darken the circumambient
air: every afternoon removing it, together with
the other trappings of the ritual&mdash;the candlesticks and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
furniture. It is not without reason that the French
undertaker ambushes beneath the imposing style of
Pompes Funèbres.</p>

<p>It was, by the way, on the walls of Saint Eugène,
each side of the door, that I first saw any of those
curious affiches, made, I suppose, necessary, or at any rate
prudent, by recent events in France, directing notice to&mdash;advertising,
I almost wrote, and indeed why not?&mdash;the
advantages of religion. Religion (this is what the
notice came to in essence), religion has its points after all.
When President Fallières' daughter was married, it remarked,
where was the ceremony performed? In a church.
(Ha, Ha!) Who, it asked, is called to visit a man on his
death-bed, no matter how wicked he has been? A priest.
(Touché!) And so forth. Surely a strange document.</p>

<p>In the same street is an old book-stall whose shelves
are fastened to the wall, giving the appearance of an
open-air library for all&mdash;the Carnegie idea at its best.
There used to be one on the side of the Hôtel Chatham
in the Rue Volney (opposite Henry's excellent American
Bar) but it has now gone.</p>

<p>We may regain the Boulevards by turning down the
long Rue du Faubourg Poissonière, which leads direct,
through the Rue Montorgeuil, to the Halles and the
Pont Neuf&mdash;a very good walk. Passing Marguery's
great restaurant on the left, famous for its filet de sole
in a special sauce, which every one should eat once if
only to see the great Marguery on his triumphant progress
through the rooms, bending his white mane over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
honoured guests, we come to a strange thing&mdash;a massive
archway in the road, parallel with the pavements, which
I think needs a little explanation. It will take us far
from the Grands Boulevards: as far, in fact, as <i>The
Golden Legend</i>; for the arch is the Porte St. Denis, and
St. Denis is the patron saint of Paris.</p>

<p>St. Denis was not a Frenchman but an Athenian,
who was converted by St. Paul in person, after considerable
discussion. Indeed, discussion was not enough: it
needed a miracle to win him wholly. "And as," wrote
Caxton, "S. Denis disputed yet with S. Paul, there
passed by adventure by that way a blind man tofore them,
and anon Denis said to Paul: If thou say to this blind
man in the name of thy God: See, and then he seeth,
I shall anon believe in him, but thou shalt use no words
of enchantment, for thou mayst haply know some words
that have such might and virtue. And S. Paul said:
I shall write tofore the form of the words, which be
these: In the name of Jesu Christ, born of the virgin,
crucified and dead, which arose again and ascended into
heaven, and from thence shall come for to judge the
world: See. And because that all suspicion be taken
away, Paul said to Denis that he himself should pronounce
the words. And when Denis had said those
words in the same manner to the blind man, anon the
blind man recovered his sight. And then Denis was
baptized and Damaris his wife and all his meiny, and
was a true Christian man and was instructed and taught
by S. Paul three years, and was ordained bishop of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
Athens, and there was in predication, and converted that
city, and great part of the region, to christian faith."</p>

<p>Denis was sent to France by Pope Clement, and he
converted many Parisians and built many churches,
until the hostile strategy of the Emperor Domitian prevailed
and he was tortured, the scene of the tragedy
being Montmartre. "The day following," says Caxton,
"Denis was laid upon a gridiron, and stretched all
naked upon the coals of fire, and there he sang to our
Lord saying: Lord thy word is vehemently fiery, and
thy servant is embraced in the love thereof. And after
that he was put among cruel beasts, which were excited
by great hunger and famine by long fasting, and as
soon as they came running upon him he made the sign
of the cross against them, and anon they were made
most meek and tame. And after that he was cast into a
furnace of fire, and the fire anon quenched, and he had
neither pain ne harm. And after that he was put on
the cross, and thereon he was long tormented, and after,
he was taken down and put into a dark prison with his
fellows and many other Christian men.</p>

<p>"And as he sang there the mass and communed the
people, our Lord appeared to him with great light, and
delivered to him bread, saying: Take this, my dear
friend, for thy reward is most great with me. After
this they were presented to the judge and were put
again to new torments, and then he did do smite off
the heads of the three fellows, that is to say, Denis,
Rusticus, and Eleutherius, in confessing the name of
the holy Trinity. And this was done by the temple of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
Mercury, and they were beheaded with three axes. And
anon the body of S. Denis raised himself up, and bare
his head between his arms, as the angel led him two
leagues from the place, which is said the hill of the
martyrs, unto the place where he now resteth, by his
election, and by the purveyance of God. And there
was heard so great and sweet a melody of angels that
many of them that heard it believed in our Lord."</p>

<p>Any one making the pilgrimage from, say, Notre
Dame to the town of St. Denis to-day, can follow the
saint's footsteps, for the Rue St. Denis at the foot of
Montmartre leads out into the Rue du Faubourg St.
Denis, and that street right over Montmartre, Caxton's
hill of the martyrs, to St. Denis itself. I do not pretend
that the legend as it is thus given has not been subjected
to severe criticism; but when one has no certain
knowledge, the best story can be considered the best
evidence, and I like Caxton better than the others, even
though it conflicts a little with the legend of St.
Geneviève. It is she, I might add, who is credited with
having inaugurated the pilgrimage to St. Denis's bones.</p>

<p>The Rue St. Denis was more than the road to the
saint's remains: it was the great north road out of Paris
to the sea. Just as the old Londoners bound for the
north left by the City Road and passed through the
village of Highgate, so did the French traveller leave
by the Rue St. Denis and pass through the village of
St. Denis. Similarly the Rue St. Martin was the high-road
to Germany. In the old days, when this street
was a highway, the Porte St. Denis had some meaning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
for it stood as a gateway between the city and the
country; but to-day, when the course of traffic is east
and west, it stands (like the Porte St. Martin) merely
as an obstruction in the Grand Boulevard&mdash;not quite so
foolish as our own revised Marble Arch, but nearly
so. The Porte St. Denis dates from 1673 and celebrates,
as the bas-reliefs indicate, the triumphs of
Louis XIV. in Germany and Holland; the Porte
St. Martin (to which we are just coming) belongs to
the same period and commemorates other successes of
the same monarch.</p>

<p>The Rue St. Denis is one of the most entertaining
of the old streets of Paris, although adulterated a little
by omnibuses and a sense of commerce. But to have
boundless time before one, and no cares, and no fatigue,
and starting at the Porte St. Denis to loiter along it
prepared to penetrate every inviting court and alluring
by-street&mdash;that is a great luxury. The first theatre in
Paris, and indeed in France, was in the Hospital of the
Trinity in the Rue St. Denis. That was early in the
fifteenth century, and it was designed for the performance
of Mystery plays in which the protagonist was, of
course, Jesus Christ. Paris has now many theatres,
with other ideals; but whatever their programmes may
be, they proceed from that early and pious spring.</p>

<p>We come next to the Boulevard de Strasbourg, running
north to the Gare de l'Est, and the Boulevard
de Sébastopol, running south to the Ile de la Cité;
and then to the second archway, the Porte St. Martin.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
St. Martin (who was Bishop of Tours) lived in Paris for
a while, and it was here that he performed the miracle
of healing a leper by embracing him&mdash;an act commemorated
by Henri I. in the founding of the Priory of
St. Martin, which stood a little way down the Rue
St. Martin on the left, on a site on which the Musée
des Arts et Métiers now stands. But it was at Amiens
that the saint's most beautiful act&mdash;the gift of his cloak
to a beggar&mdash;was performed, and perhaps I may be
allowed to quote here, from another book of mine, the
translation of a poem by M. Haraucourt, the curator of
the Cluny museum, celebrating that deed:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
<span class="i4">CHARITY</span></p>

<p class="poem">Because so bitter was the rain,<br />
Saint Martin cut his cloak in twain,<br />
<span class="i1">And gave the beggar half of it</span><br />
To cover him and ease his pain.</p>

<p class="poem">But being now himself ill clad,<br />
The Saint's own case was no less sad.<br />
<span class="i1">So piteously cold the night;</span><br />
Though glad at heart he was, right glad.</p>

<p class="poem">Thus, singing, on his way he passed,<br />
While Satan, grim and overcast,<br />
<span class="i1">Vowing the Saint should rue his deed,</span><br />
Released the cruel Northern blast.</p>

<p class="poem">Away it sprang with shriek and roar,<br />
And buffeted the Saint full sore,<br />
<span class="i1">Yet never wished he for his cloak;</span><br />
So Satan bade the deluge pour.</p>

<p class="poem">Huge hail-stones joined in the attack,<br />
And dealt Saint Martin many a thwack,<br />
<span class="i1">"My poor old head!" he smiling said,</span><br />
Yet never wished his cape were back.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span></p>

<p class="poem">"He must, he shall," cried Satan, "know<br />
Regret for such an act," and lo,<br />
<span class="i1">E'en as he spoke the world was dark</span><br />
With fog and frost and whirling snow.</p>

<p class="poem">Saint Martin, struggling toward his goal,<br />
Mused thoughtfully, "Poor soul! poor soul!<br />
<span class="i1">What use to him was half a cloak?</span><br />
I should have given him the whole."</p>

<p class="poem">The cold grew terrible to bear,<br />
The birds fell frozen in the air:<br />
<span class="i1">"Fall thou," said Satan, "on the ice</span><br />
Fall thou asleep, and perish there."</p>

<p class="poem">He fell, and slept, despite the storm,<br />
And dreamed he saw the Christ Child's form<br />
<span class="i1">Wrapped in the half the beggar took,</span><br />
And seeing Him, was warm, so warm.
</p>

<p>The Arts et Métiers is a museum devoted to the
progress of mechanics and the useful crafts: a kind of
industrial exhibition, a modern utilitarian Cluny. It
is a memorial of the world's ingenuity and the ingenuity
of France in particular, and one cannot have a much
better reminder that the frivolity of the Grands Boulevards
is not all. Apropos, however, of the frivolity of
the Grands Boulevards, I may say that the case that
was attracting most interest on the Sunday that I was
here contained a collection of all the best mechanical
toys of the past dozen years, with their dates affixed.
The only article in the vast building which seemed to
serve no useful purpose was a mirror cracked during the
Commune by a bullet, with the bullet still in it. In the
square opposite the Musée is the statue of Béranger, who
for many years made the ballads of the French nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
Returning to the Grands Boulevards once more, we
pass first the Porte St. Martin theatre, where the great
Coquelin played Cyrano, and where he was rehearsing
<i>Chantecler</i> when he died, and then the Ambigu,
home of sensational melodrama, and come very shortly
to the Place de la République, with its great central
monument. The Republic thus celebrated is not merely
the Third and present Republic, but all the efforts in
that direction which the French have made, as the
twelve reliefs round the base will show, for they begin
with the scene in the Jeu de Paume in 1789, and end
with the National Fête on July 14th, 1880. Paris would
still have statues of the République if this were to go,
for there is one by Dalou, the sculptor of these bas-reliefs,
in the Place de la Nation, and another by Soitoux
at the Institut. Dalou (whose work we saw in such
profusion at the Little Palace in the Champs-Elysées)
made a very spirited and characteristic group, with the
Republic standing high on a chariot being drawn by
lions and urged forward by an ouvrier and an ouvrière.</p>

<p>There is another and hardly less direct walk eastward
to the Place de la République, which, taken slowly and
amusedly, instructs one as fully in the manners of the
busy small Parisian as the Boulevards in those of the
flâneur. This route is by the Rue de Provence, the
Rue Richer, the Rue des Petites-Ecuries and the Rue
Château-d'Eau&mdash;practically a straight line, and in the
old days a highway. You see the small Parisian at his
busiest&mdash;at her busiest&mdash;this way.

<p>One may gain Montmartre by every street that
runs off the Grands Boulevards on the left, between
the Opéra and the Place de la République; but
when the night falls and the tide begins to turn that
way, it is the Rue Blanche and the Rue Pigalle that do
most of the work. All are very steep. To the wayfarer
climbing the hill in no hurry, I recommend for
its interest the Rue des Martyrs (Balzac once lived at
No. 47), leading out of the Rue Laffitte; or, starting
from the Boulevards at a more easterly point, one may
gain it by the Rue du Faubourg Montmartre, which runs
into the Rue des Martyrs at Notre Dame de Lorette
and is full of activity and variety.</p>

<p>By taking the Rue de la Rochefoucauld one may
spend a few minutes in a little white building there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
which was once the home and studio of the painter
Gustave Moreau and is now left to the nation as a
permanent memorial of his labours. In industry the
man must have approached Rubens and Rembrandt,
for this, though a large house, is literally filled with
paintings and drawings and studies, which not only
cover the walls but cover screens built into the walls,
and screens within screens, and screens within those.
The menuisier and Moreau together have contrived to
make No. 14 Rue de la Rochefoucauld the most tiring
house in Paris&mdash;at least to me, who do not admire
the work of this painter, or at any rate do not want
to see more of it than is in the Luxembourg, where
may be seen several of his pictures, including the most
famous of all, the Salome. Herr Baedeker considers
that Moreau's works have a charm of their own, but
I do not find it. I find a striving after the grandiose
and startling, with only occasional lapses into sincerity
and good colour. It is better than Wiertz, no doubt;
but less entertaining, because less shocking.</p>

<p>Montmartre's life may for our purpose be divided
into three distinct periods: day, evening, and the small
hours. By day one may roam its streets of living and
of dead and study Paris from its summit; in the evening
its cabarets are in full swing; and then comes midnight
when its supper cafés open, not to close or cease
their melodies until the shops are doing business again.</p>

<p>Montmartre (so called because it was here that St.
Denis and his associates were put to death) really is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
mountain, as any one who has climbed to the Sacré-C&oelig;ur
can tell. The last two hundred yards are indeed
nearly as steep as the Brecon Beacons; but the climb is
worth it if only for the view of Paris. (There is, however,
a funicular railway.) As for the cathedral, that
seems to me to be better seen and appreciated from the
distance: from the train as one enters Paris in the late
afternoon, with the level sun lighting its pure walls;
from the heights on the south side of the river; from
the Boulevard des Italiens up the Rue Laffitte; and
from the Buttes-Chaumont, as in Mr. Dexter's exquisite
drawing. For the cathedral itself is not particularly
attractive near at hand, and within it is cold and
dull and still awaiting its glass. It was, however, one
of the happiest thoughts that has come to Rome in
our time to set this fascinating bizarre Oriental building
here. It gave Paris a new note that it will now never
lose.</p>

<p>Before leaving, one ought perhaps to have a peep at
Françoise-Marguerite, for one is not likely to see her
equal again. Françoise-Marguerite, otherwise known
as La Savoyarde de Montmartre, is the great bell given
to the cathedral by the province of Savoy. She weighs
nineteen tons, is nine feet tall, and her voice has remarkable
timbre.</p>

<p>Behind the new cathedral lies the old church of St.
Pierre-de-Montmartre, on the side of which, it is said,
once stood a temple of Mars. (Hence, for some lexicographers,
Mont-Mars and Montmartre; but I prefer to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
think of St. Denis wandering here without his head.)
It was in the crypt of this church, I have somewhere
read, that Ignatius Loyola, with Xavier and Laine,
founded the order of Jesuits.</p>

<p>I attended early mass at the Sacré-C&oelig;ur church on
January 1st, 1908. It was snowing lightly and very
cold, and as I came away, at about eight, and descended
the hill towards Paris, I was struck by the spectacle
of the lame and blind and miserable men and women
who were appearing mysteriously from nowhere to descend
the hill too, groping and hobbling down the
slippery steepnesses. Such folk are an uncommon sight
in Paris, where every one seems to be, if not robust, at
any rate active and capable, and where, although it
eminently belongs to the poor as much as to the rich,
extreme poverty is rarely seen. In London, where the
poor convey no possessive impression, but, except in
their own quarters, suggest that they are here on
sufferance, one sees much distress. In Paris none,
except on this day, the first of the year&mdash;and on one
or two others, such as July 14th&mdash;when beggars are
allowed to ask alms in the streets. For the rest of the
year they must hide their misery and their want, although
I still tremble a little as I remember the importunities
of the Montmartre cripple of ferocious aspect
and no legs at all, fixed into a packing-case on wheels,
who, having demanded alms in vain, hurls himself night
after night along the pavement after the hard-hearted,
urging his torso's chariot by powerful strokes of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
huge hands on the pavement, as though he rowed
against Leander, with such menacing fury that I for one
have literally taken to my heels. He is the only beggar
I recollect meeting except on the permitted days, and
then Paris swarms with them.</p>

<p>Standing on the dome of the cathedral one has the
city at one's feet, not as wonderfully as on the Eiffel
Tower, but nearly so. From the Buttes-Chaumont we
see Montmartre: here we see the Buttes-Chaumont,
which, before it was a park, shared with Montmartre
the gypsum quarries from which plaster of Paris is
made. Beyond the Buttes-Chaumont is Père Lachaise,
a hill strangely mottled by its grave-stones, while immediately
below us is the Cimetière du Nord, which we
are about to visit for the sake of certain very interesting
tombs.</p>

<p>One realises quickly the strategical value of this mountain.
Paris has indeed been bombarded from it twice&mdash;by
Henri IV., and again, only thirty-eight years ago.
It was indeed on Montmartre that the Communard insurrection
began, for it was the cannon on these heights
that the rebel soldiers at once made for after the assassination
of their officers. They held them for a while,
but were then overpowered and forced to take up their
quarters in the Buttes-Chaumont and Père Lachaise,
which were shelled by the National Guard from Montmartre
until the brief but terrible mutiny was over.</p>

<p>The great dome, close by us on the left, which might
be another Panthéon, crowns the Maison Dufayel. Who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
is Dufayel? you ask. Well, who is Wanamaker, who
was Whiteley? M. Dufayel is the head of the gigantic
business in the Boulevard Barbès, a northern continuation
of the Boulevard de Magenta. His advertisements
are on every hoarding. I think the Maison Dufayel is
well worth a visit, especially as there is no need to buy
anything: you may instead sip an apéritif, listen to the
band or watch the cinematoscope. One also need have
none of that fear of what would happen were there to
be a sudden panic which always keeps me nervous if ever
I am lured into the Magasins du Louvre or the Galeries
Lafayette; for at Dufayel's there is space, whereas at
those vast shopping centres there is a congestion that,
in a time of stress would lead to perfectly awful results.
The Maison Dufayel is not so varied a repository as
Wanamaker's or Whiteley's: but in its way it is hardly
less remarkable. Its principal line is furniture, and I
never saw so many beds in my life. It was M. Dufayel
who brought to perfection the deposit system of payment,
and his agents continually range the otherwise
pleasant land of France, collecting instalments.</p>

<p>Since I had wandered into this monstrous establishment,
which may not be as large as Harrod's Stores but
feels infinitely vaster, I determined to buy something,
and decided at last upon a French picture-book for an
English child. Buying it was a simple operation, but
I then made the mistake of asking that it might be
sent to England direct. One should never do that in a
bureaucratic country. The lady led me for what seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
several miles through various departments until we came
late in the day to rows and rows of Frenchmen and
Frenchwomen each in a little glass box. These boxes
were numbered and ran to hundreds. We stopped at last
before, say, 157, where my guide left me. The Frenchman
in the box denied at once that the book could go
by post. It was too large. It must go by rail. For
myself, I did not then care how it went or if it went at
all: I was tired out. But feeling that such an act as to
abandon the parcel and run would be misconstrued
and resented in a home of such perfect mechanical order,
I waited until he had written for a quarter of an hour in
a fine flowing hand with a pen sharper than a serpent's
tooth, and then I paid the required number of francs and
set out on the desperate errand of finding the street
again. The book was a week on its journey. Go to
Dufayel's, I say, most certainly, for it is quite amusing;
but go when you are young and strong.</p>

<p>To me the most interesting thing on Montmartre is
the grave of Heinrich Heine in the Cimetière du Nord,
a strange irregular city of dead Parisians all tidily laid
away in their homes in its many streets, over which a
busy rumbling thoroughfare has been carried on a viaduct.
I had Heine's <i>Salon</i> with me when I was last in Paris,
and I sought his grave again one afternoon with an increased
sense of intimacy. A medallion portrait of the
mournful face is cut in the marble, and on the grave
itself are wistful echoes of the <i>Buch der Lieder</i>. A little
tin receptacle is fixed to the stone, and I looked at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
cards which in the pretty German way visitors had left
upon the poet and his wife; for Frau Heine lies too
here. All were German and all rain-soaked (or was it
tears?)</p>

<p>Heine has many illustrious companions. If you would
stand by the grave of Berlioz and Ambroise Thomas, of
Offenbach, who set all Europe humming, of Delibes the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
composer of Genée's "Coppélia," of the brothers Goncourt,
of Renan, who wrote the <i>Life of Christ</i>, or of
Henri Murger, who discovered Bohemia, of De Neuville,
painter of battles, of Halévy and Meilhac the playwrights,
or of Théophile Gautier the poet, you must seek
the Cimetière du Nord.</p>

<p>Montmartre in the evening centres in the Boulevard de
Clichy&mdash;a high-spirited thoroughfare. Many foreigners
visit it only then, and the Boulevard spreads its wares
accordingly, and very tawdry some of them are. Here,
for example, is a garish façade labelled "Ciel," in which
a number of grubby blackguards dressed as saints and
angels first bring refreshments at a franc a glass, and
then offer the visitor a "prêche humoristique" followed
by variations of Pepper's ghost in what are called "scènes
paradisiaques," the whole performance being cold, tawdry
and very stupid. Next door is "Enfer," where similar
delights are offered, save that here the suggestion is not
of heaven but hell. Instead therefore of grubby blackguards
as saints we have grubby blackguards as devils.
On the opposite side of the road is the Cabaret du
Néant, where you are received with a mass for the dead
sung by the staff, and sit at tables made of coffins.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that very few Parisians
enter these places. The singing cabarets, however, are
different: they are genuine, and one needs to be not
only a Parisian but a very well-informed Parisian to
appreciate them, for the songs are palpitatingly topical
and political. The Quatz'-Arts, the Lune-Rousse and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
the Chat-Noir (once so famous, but now lacking in the
genius either of Salis, its founder, or of Caran d'Ache,
Steinlen or Willette, who helped to make it renowned)
are all in the Boulevard de Clichy. So also is Aristide
Bruant's cabaret, where an organised shout of welcome
awaits every visitor, and Aristide&mdash;in costume a cross
between a poet and a cowboy&mdash;sings his realistic ballads
of Parisian street life. Here also is the Moulin-Rouge,
which in the old days of the elephant was in its spurious
way amusing, but is now rebuilt and redecorated out of
knowledge, and for all the words you hear might be on
Broadway.</p>

<p>Here also, at the extreme western end of the Boulevard,
is the Hippodrome, now a hippodrome only in name and
given up to the popular cinematoscope. I regret the
loss of the real Paris Hippodrome. Paris still has her
permanent circuses, but the Hippodrome is gone. It was
there that, one night, in 1889, I chanced to sit very near
the royal box, into which, with much bowing and scraping
of managers, a white-haired old gentleman with the
features of a lion and an eagle harmoniously blended
was ushered. He was only seventy-nine, this old gentleman,
and he was in the thick of such duties as fall to
the Leader of the Opposition and promoter of Home
Rule for Ireland; but he followed every step of the
performance like a schoolboy, and now and then he sent
for an official to have something explained to him, such
as, on one occasion, the workings of the artificial
snow-storm which overwhelmed Skobeleff's army. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
ill-fated Russian general was the hero of the spectacle,
a remarkable one in its way; but to me the restless
animation and whole-hearted enjoyment of Mr. Gladstone
was the finer entertainment.</p>

<p>Montmartre has also three dancing halls, two of which
are genuine and one a show-place. The genuine halls
are the Moulin-de-la-Galette, high on the hill on the
steepest part of it above the Moulin-Rouge, and the
Elysée in the Boulevard de Rochechouart, which are
open only two or three times a week and which are
thronged by the shop-assistants and young people of
the neighbourhood. The spurious hall is the Bal Tabarin,
which is open every evening and is a spectacle.
It is, however, by no means unamusing, and I have spent
many pleasant idle hours there. Willette's famous fresco
of the apotheosis of the Parisian leg decorates a wall-space
over the bar with peculiar fitness. At all the
bals the men who dance retain their hats and often
their overcoats, and for the most part leave their partners
with amazing abruptness at the last step. Some of the
measures are conspicuous for a lack of restraint that
would decimate an English ballroom; but one must not
take such displays "at the foot of the letter": they do
not mean among these Latin romps and frolics what
they would mean with us, whose emotions are less facile
and sense of fun less physical.</p>

<p>And so we come to midnight, when Montmartre
enters its third, and, to a Londoner exasperated by the
grandmotherly legislation of his own city, its most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
entertaining phase. The idea that Paris is a late city
is an illusion. Paris is not a late city: it is a city with
a few late streets. Paris as a whole goes to bed as early
as London, if not earlier, as a walk in the residential
quarters will prove. Montmartre is late, and the Boulevards
des Capucines and des Italiens are late, although
less so; and that is about all. When it is remembered
that Paris rises and opens its shops some hours earlier
than London, and that the Parisians value their health,
it will be recognised that Paris could not be a late city.
One must remember also that the number of all-night
cafés is very small, so small that by frequenting them
with any diligence one may soon come to know by sight
most of the late fringe of this city, both amateurs and
professionals. One is indeed quickly struck by their
numerical weakness.</p>

<p>There is a fashion in night cafés as in hats; change
is made as suddenly and as inexplicably. One month
every one is crowding into, let us say, the Chat Vivant,
and the next the Chat Vivant kindles its lamps and
tweaks its mandolins in vain: all the world passes its
doors on the way to the Nid de Nuit. What is the
reason? No one knows exactly; but we must probably
once again seek the woman. A new dancer (or shall I say
attachée?) has appeared, or an old dancer or attachée
transferred her allegiance. And so for a while the Nid
has not a free table after one o'clock, and on a special
night&mdash;such as Mi-Carême, or Réveillon, or New Year's
Eve&mdash;it is the head-waiter and the door-keeper of the Nid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
into whose hands are pressed the gold coins and bank
notes to influence them to admit the bloods and their
parties and find them a table. A year ago the douceur
(often fruitless) would have gone to the officials of the
Chat Vivant.</p>

<p>They remain, when all has been said against them,
simple and well-mannered places, these half-dozen famous
cafés on which the sun always rises. To think so one
must perhaps graduate on the Boulevards, but once
they are accepted they can become an agreeable habit.
Sleepiness is as unknown there as the writings of Thomas
à Kempis. Not only the dancers de la maison but the
visitors too are tireless. There may be ways of getting
ennui into a Parisian girl, but certainly it is not by
dancing. Nor does the band tire either, one excellent
rule at all of them being that there should be no pause
whatever between the tunes, from the hour of opening
until day.</p>

<p>There lies before me as I write an amusing memorial
of the innocent high spirits that can prevail on such a
special all-night sitting as Réveillon: one of the tails
of a dress coat, lined with white satin on which a skilful
hand has traced with a fountain pen (my own) two very
intimate scenes of French life. These drawings were
made between five and six in the morning in the intervals
of the dance, the artist, lacking paper, having without
a word taken a table knife and shorn off his coat-tails for
the purpose. His coat, I may say, was already being
worn inside out, with one of the leather buckles of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
braces as a button-hole. A tall burly man, with a long
red Boulevard beard, he had thrown out signs of friendliness
to me at once, and we became as brothers. He
drew my portrait on the table-cloth; I affected to draw
his. He showed me where I was wrong and drew it
right. He then left me, in order to walk for a while on
an imaginary tight-rope across the floor, and having
safely made the journey and turned again, with infinite
skill in his recoveries from falling and the most dexterous
managing of a balancing-pole that did not exist, he
leaped lightly to earth again, kissed his hand to the
company, and again sat by me and resumed his work;
finally, after other diversions, completing the chef d'&oelig;uvre
that is now lying on my desk and lending abandon to
what is otherwise a stronghold of British decorum. We
parted at seven. I have never seen him since, but I find
his name often in the French comic papers illustrating
yet other phases of their favourite pleasantry for the
entertainment of this simple and tireless people.</p>

<p>Another incident I recall that is equally characteristic
of Montmartre. "Ça ne fait rien," said a head-waiter
when we had expressed regret on hearing of the death
of the maître d'hotel, for whom (an old acquaintance)
we had been asking. "Ça ne fait rien: it is necessary
to order supper just the same." True. True indeed
everywhere, but particularly true on Montmartre.

<p>The Elysée, the official home of the French president&mdash;Paris's
White House and Buckingham
Palace&mdash;is situated in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré,
which is one of the most entertaining streets
in the whole city in which to loiter; that is, if you like,
as I do, the windows of curiosity dealers and jewellers
and print shops. Not that bargains are to be obtained
here: far from it: it is not like the Rue des Saints Pères
or the Rue Mazarine across the river; but merely as a
series of windows it is fascinating. I like it as much as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
I dislike the Rue Lafayette, which has always been my
aversion, not only because it is interminable and commercial
and noisy, but because it leads back to England
and work; yet since, however, when one arrives in Paris
it leads from England and work, I must be a little
lenient, and there is also a café in it where the diamond
merchants compare gems quite openly.</p>

<p>Remembering these extenuating circumstances I unhesitatingly
award the palm for undesirability in a Paris
street to the Rue du Quatre-Septembre and the Rue
Réaumur, which are sheer Shaftesbury Avenue, and, as
in Shaftesbury Avenue, cause one to regret the older
streets and houses whose place they have usurped. The
Rue de Rivoli I dislike too: that strange mixture of very
good hotels (the Meurice, for instance, is here) and
rubbishy shops full of tawdry jewellery to catch the
excursionist. How it happened that such a site should
have been allowed to fall into such hands is a mystery.
An additional objection to the Rue de Rivoli is that
the one English acquaintance whom one least wishes to
meet is always there.</p>

<p>The Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré becomes the
Rue Saint-Honoré at the Rue Royale. The Rue Saint-Honoré
is also a good street for shop windows, but not
the equal of its more aristocratic half; just as that is
surpassed here by the Rue de la Paix, to which we now
come on the left, and which contains more things that
I can do without, made to perfection, than any street
I ever saw. At its foot is the Place Vendôme, with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
beautiful column in the midst on which Napoleon's
campaign of 1805 is illustrated in a bronze spiral that
constitutes at once, I suppose, the most durable and
the longest picture in the world. The bronze came very
properly from the melted Russian and Austrian cannons.
Napoleon stands at the top, imperially splendid; but
as we saw in the chapter on the "Ile de la Cité," it was
not always so: for his first statue was removed by Louis
XVIII. to be used for the new Henri IV. In its stead
a fleur-de-lys surmounted the column. Then came
Louis-Philippe, who erected a new statue of the Emperor,
not, however, imperially clad; and then Napoleon
III., who substituted the present figure. But in 1870
the Communards succeeded in bringing the column down,
and it has only been vertical again since 1875. Thus
it is to be a Paris monument!</p>

<p>Returning to the Rue Saint-Honoré, in which, by the
way, are several old and interesting houses, such as
No. 271, the Cabaret du Saint-Esprit, a great resort in
the Reign of Terror of spectators wishing to see the
tumbrils pass, and No. 398, where Robespierre lodged,
we come to St. Roch's church, on the left, interesting
both in itself and in history. It has been called the
noisiest church in Paris, and certainly it is difficult to
find a time when feet are silent there. The attraction is
St. Roch's wealth of shrines, of a rather theatrical character,
such as the wise poor love: an entombment, a
calvary and a nativity, all very effective if not beautiful.
Beauty does not matter, for on Good Friday the entombment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
holds thousands silent before it. The church,
which is in the baroque style that it is so easy to
dislike, is too florid throughout. Among the many
monuments are memorials of Corneille and Diderot,
both of whom are buried here. The music of St. Roch
is, I am told, second only to that of the Madeleine.</p>

<p>So much for St. Roch within. Historically it
chances to be of immense importance, for it was here,
and in the streets around and about the church, that
the whiff of grapeshot blew which dispersed the French
Revolution into the air. That was on October 5th, 1795,
and it was not only the death of the Revolution but it
was the birth of the conquering Buonaparte. Carlyle
is superb: "Some call for Barras to be made Commandant;
he conquered in Thermidor. Some, what is more
to the purpose, bethink them of the Citizen Buonaparte,
unemployed Artillery-Officer, who took Toulon. A
man of head, a man of action: Barras is named Commandant's-Cloak;
this young Artillery-Officer is named
Commandant. He was in the Gallery at the moment,
and heard it; he withdrew, some half-hour, to consider
with himself: after a half-hour of grim compressed considering,
to be or not to be, he answers <i>Yea</i>.</p>

<p>"And now, a man of head being at the centre of it,
the whole matter gets vital. Swift, to Camp of Sablons;
to secure the Artillery, there are not twenty men
guarding it! A swift Adjutant, Murat is the name of
him, gallops; gets thither some minutes within time,
for Lepelletier was also on march that way: the Cannon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
are ours. And now beset this post, and beset that;
rapid and firm: at Wicket of the Louvre, in Cul-de-sac
Dauphin, in Rue Saint-Honoré, from Pont-Neuf all
along the north Quays, southward to Pont <i>ci-devant</i>
Royal,&mdash;rank round the Sanctuary of the Tuileries, a
ring of steel discipline; let every gunner have his match
burning, and all men stand to their arms!</p>

<p>"Lepelletier has seized the Church of Saint-Roch; has
seized the Pont-Neuf, our piquet there retreating without
fire. Stray shots fall from Lepelletier; rattle down
on the very Tuileries Staircase. On the other hand,
women advance dishevelled, shrieking, Peace; Lepelletier
behind them waving his hat in sign that we shall
fraternise. Steady! The Artillery-Officer is steady as
bronze; can, if need were, be quick as lightning. He
sends eight-hundred muskets with ball-cartridges to the
Convention itself; honourable Members shall act with
these in case of extremity: whereat they look grave
enough. Four of the afternoon is struck. Lepelletier,
making nothing by messengers, by fraternity or hat-waving,
bursts out, along the Southern Quai Voltaire,
along streets and passages, treble-quick, in huge veritable
onslaught! Whereupon, thou bronze Artillery-Officer&mdash;?
'Fire!' say the bronze lips. And roar and
thunder, roar and again roar, continual, volcano-like,
goes his great gun, in the Cul-de-sac Dauphin against
the Church of Saint-Roch; go his great guns on the
Pont-Royal; go all his great guns;&mdash;blow to air some
two-hundred men, mainly about the Church of Saint-Roch!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
Lepelletier cannot stand such horse-play; no
Sectioner can stand it; the Forty-thousand yield on all
sides, scour towards covert. 'Some hundred or so of
them gathered about the Théâtre de la République;
but,' says he, 'a few shells dislodged them. It was all
finished at six.'</p>

may; sacred right of Insurrection is gone forever!
The Sieyes Constitution can disembark itself, and begin
marching. The miraculous Convention Ship has got
to land;&mdash;and is there, shall we figuratively say, changed,
as Epic Ships are wont, into a kind of <i>Sea Nymph</i>,
never to sail more; to roam the waste Azure, a Miracle
in History!</p>

<p>"'It is false,' says Napoleon, 'that we fired first with
blank charge; it had been a waste of life to do that.'
Most false: the firing was with sharp and sharpest
shot: to all men it was plain that here was no sport;
the rabbets and plinths of Saint-Roch Church show
splintered by it to this hour.&mdash;Singular: in old Broglie's
time, six years ago, this Whiff of Grapeshot was promised;
but it could not be given then; could not have
profited then. Now, however, the time is come for it,
and the man; and behold, you have it; and the thing
we specifically call <i>French Revolution</i> is blown into
space by it, and become a thing that was!&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span></p>

<p>Crossing the Place du Théâtre-Français we come to
that historic home of the best French drama, where
Molière is still played frequently, and one has some respite
from the theme of facile promiscuity which dominates
most of the other theatres of Paris. A new statue
of Alfred de Musset has lately been set up under the
Comédie Française. I copy from a writer very unlike
him a passage of criticism to remember as one stands
by this monument: "Give a look, if you can, at a
Memoir of Alfred de Musset written by his Brother.
Making allowance for French morals, and Absinthe
(which latter is not mentioned in the Book), Alfred
appears to me a fine Fellow, very un-French in some
respects. He did not at all relish the new Romantic
School, beginning with V. Hugo, and now alive in &mdash;&mdash; and
Co.&mdash;(what I call the Gargoyle School of Art,
whether in Poetry, Painting, or Music)&mdash;he detested
the modern 'feuilleton' Novel, and read Clarissa!...
Many years before A. de M. died he had a bad, long,
illness, and was attended by a Sister of Charity. When
she left she gave him a Pen with 'Pensez à vos promesses'
worked about in coloured silks: as also a little
worsted 'Amphore' she had knitted at his bedside.
When he came to die, some seventeen years after, he
had these two little things put with him in his Coffin."
That, by Edward FitzGerald, no natural friend to the
de Mussets of the world, is very pretty.</p>

<p>The Rue de Richelieu runs up beside the Comédie
Française. We have already been in this street to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
the Bibliothèque Nationale, entering it from the Boulevard,
but let us now walk up it, first to see the Molière
monument, so appropriate just here, and also to glance
at No. 50, a house still unchanged, where once lived an insignificant
couple named Poisson, whose daughter Jeanne
Antoinette Poisson lived to become famous as Madame
La Pompadour. In souvenirs of Molière Paris is still
rich. We are coming soon to No. 92 Rue Saint-Honoré,
where he was born; we are coming to the church of St.
Eustache, where he was christened on January 15th, 1622,
and where his second son was christened too. We are
coming also to the church of St. Germain l'Auxerrois,
where he was married and where his first son was baptised.
In St. Roch he once stood as a godfather; and close to
us now, at the corner of the Rue Saint-Honoré and the
Rue Valois, was one of his theatres. And he died close
to his monument, at No. 40 Rue de Richelieu. This
then is the Molière quarter.</p>

<p>We now enter the Palais Royal, that strange white
and green oasis into which it is so simple never to stray.
When I first knew Paris the Palais Royal was filled with
cheap restaurants and shops to allure the excursionist
and the connoisseur of those books which an inspired
catalogue once described as very curious and disgusting.
It is now practically deserted; the restaurants have
gone and few shops remain; but in the summer the
band plays to happy crowds, and children frolic here all
day. I have, however, never succeeded in shaking off
a feeling of depression.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span></p>

<p>The original palace was built by Richelieu and was
then the Palais Cardinal. After his death it became
the Palais Royal and was enlarged, and was the scene
of notorious orgies. Camille Desmoulins made it more
serious, for it was here that he enflamed the people by
his words on July 12th, 1789, and started them on their
destroying career. That was in the Café de Foy. Carlyle
thus describes the scene: "But see Camille Desmoulins,
from the Café de Foy, rushing out, sibylline in face; his
hair streaming, in each hand a pistol! He springs to a
table: the Police satellites are eyeing him; alive they
shall not take him, not they alive him alive. This time
he speaks without stammering:&mdash;Friends! shall we die
like hunted hares? Like sheep hounded into their pinfold;
bleating for mercy, where is no mercy, but only a
whetted knife? The hour is come; the supreme hour of
Frenchman and Man; when Oppressors are to try conclusions
with Oppressed; and the word is, swift Death,
or Deliverance forever. Let such hour be <i>well</i>-come! Us,
meseems, one cry only befits: To Arms! Let universal
Paris, universal France, as with the throat of the whirlwind,
sound only: To arms&mdash;To arms! yell responsive
the innumerable voices; like one great voice, as of a
Demon yelling from the air: for all faces wax fire-eyed, all
hearts burn up into madness. In such, or fitter words,
does Camille evoke the Elemental Powers, in this great
moment.&mdash;Friends, continues Camille, some rallying
sign! Cockades; green ones;&mdash;the colour of Hope!&mdash;As
with the flight of locusts, these green tree-leaves; green
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
ribands from the neighbouring shops; all green things
are snatched, and made cockades of. Camille descends
from his table, 'stifled with embraces, wetted with tears';
has a bit of green riband handed him; sticks it in his
hat. And now to Curtius' Image-shop there; to the
Boulevards; to the four winds; and rest not till France
be on fire!"</p>

<p>Desmoulins in bronze now stands in the garden, near
this spot. It is an interesting statue by Boverie, who
showed great courage in his use of a common chair,
dignified here into a worthy adjunct of liberation.</p>

<p>Under Napoleon the Tribunate sat in the Palais Royal,
and after Napoleon the Orleans family made it their
home. The Communards, always thorough, burned a
good deal of it in 1871, and it is now a desert and the
seat of the Conseil d'Etat. Let us leave it by the gateway
leading to the Rue de Valois and be happier again.</p>

<p>The Rue de Valois is an interesting and picturesque
street, but its greatest attraction to me is its association
with Charles Lamb. His hotel&mdash;the Europe, just opposite
the gateway&mdash;has recently been rebuilt and is now
called the Grand Hôtel du Palais Royal et de l'Europe,
and the polished staircase on which his infinitesimal legs
slipped about so comically on his late and not too steady
returnings (and how could he be steady when Providence
ordained that the waiter of whom in his best stammering
French he ordered an egg, on his first visit to a restaurant,
should have so misunderstood the order as to bring
in its place a glass of eau de vie&mdash;an error, we are told,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
which gave Lamb much pleasure?) the polished staircase
has now gone; but the hotel stands exactly where it
did, and every thing else is the same&mdash;the B&oelig;uf à la Mode
is still close by and still one of the best restaurants in
Paris, and the Place de Valois is untouched, with its
most attractive archway leading to the Rue des Bons-Enfants
and giving on to the vista of the Rue Montesquieu,
with its hundred signs hanging out exactly as in
1823.</p>

<p>We now return to the Rue Saint-Honoré. The three
old houses, 180, 182 and 184, opposite the Magasins
du Louvre, belonged before the Revolution to the Canons
of Saint-Honoré. The courtyard here&mdash;the Cloître du
Saint-Honoré&mdash;is one of the most characteristic examples
of dirty Paris that remain, but very picturesque too. To
peep in here is almost certainly to be rewarded by
some Hogarthian touch, and to walk up the Rue des
Bons-Enfants yields similar experiences and some very
pleasant glimpses of old Paris.</p>

<p>Still going east we turn down past the Oratoire on
the right, with Coligny's monument on its south side,
into the Rue de Rivoli, and across the Rue du Louvre
obliquely to the old church we see there, opposite the
east end of the Louvre and Napoleon's iron gates.
This church is that of St. Germain l'Auxerrois, not to
be confounded with the St. Germain of St. Germain des
Prés across the river. St. Germain l'Auxerrois is historically
one of the most interesting of the Paris churches,
for it was St. Germain's bell that gave the signal for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
the massacre of St. Bartholomew in 1572. Charles IX.
is said to have fired at the Huguenots (doubtless with
Catherine de Médicis at his shoulder, anxious for the
success of his aim) from one of the windows in the
Louvre overlooking this space.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="amateur" id="amateur"></a>

<span class="s2">DAUMIER</span><br />
<span class="s2">(<i>Palais des Beaux Arts</i>)</span></p></div>

<p>St. Germain of Auxerre began as a layman&mdash;the ruler
of Burgundy. Divine revelation, however, indicated
that the Church was his true calling, and he therefore
succeeded Saint Amadour as Bishop, "gave," in Caxton's
words, "all his riches to poor people, and changed his
wife into his sister". He took to the new life very
thoroughly. He fasted every day till evening and then
ate coarse bread and drank water and used no pottage
and no salt. "In winter ne summer he had but one
clothing, and that was the hair next his body, a coat
and a gown, and if it happed so that he gave not his
vesture to some poor body, he would wear it till it were
broken and torn. His bed was environed with ashes,
hair, and sackcloth, and his head lay no higher than his
shoulders, but all day wept, and bare about his neck
divers relics of saints. He ware none other clothing,
and he went oft barefoot and seldom ware any girdle.
The life that he led was above man's power. His life
was so straight and hard that it was marvel and pity
to see his flesh, and was like a thing not credible, and
he did so many miracles that, if his merits had not gone
before, they should have been trowed phantasms."</p>

<p>St. Germain's miracles were more interesting than
those of, say, his convert Sainte Geneviève. He conjured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
devils; he forbade fire to burn him; having fed his
companions on the only calf of a friendly cow-herd, he
put the bones and the skins together and life returned
to it; he also raised one of his own disciples from the
dead and conversed with him through the walls of his
tomb, but on the disciple saying that in his late condition
"he was well and all things were to him soft and
sweet," he permitted him to remain dead. He also
found his miraculous gifts very useful in the war; but
his principal interest to us is that he is supposed to
have visited England and organised the Establishment
here. St. Germain's church has a little old glass that
is charming and much bad new. The south transept
window, although sheer kaleidoscope, is gay and attractive.</p>

<p>At the back of the church runs the narrow and medieval
Rue de l'Arbre-Sec, extending to the Rue Saint-Honoré.
At No. 4 is, or was, the Hôtel des Mousquetaires,
where, when it was the Belle Etoile, d'Artagnan
drank and swaggered. Let us take this street and come
to St. Eustache by way of another and less terrible
souvenir of Catherine de Médicis. The Rue de l'Arbre-Sec
leads to the Rue Sauval and to the circular Rue de
Viarmes surrounding the Bourse de Commerce. Here
we see a remarkable Doric column, all that remains of
the palace which Catherine built in order to avoid the
fate predicted for her by a soothsayer&mdash;that she would
perish in the ruins of a house near St. Germain's. The
Tuileries, which she was then building, being far too near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
St. Germain's to be comfortable after such a remark, she
erected the Hôtel de la Reine, the tower being designed
for astrological study in the company of her Italian
familiar, Ruggieri. All else has gone: the tower and
the stars remain.</p>

<p>A few steps down the Rue Oblin and we are at St.
Eustache, which has to my eyes the most fascinating
roof of any church in Paris and a very attractive
nave. The interior, however, is marred by the presence
of what might be called a church within a church, destroying
all vistas, and it is only with great difficulty
that one can see the exquisite rose window over the
organ. It is a church much used by the poor&mdash;who
even call it Notre Dame des Halles&mdash;but its music on
festival days brings the rich too. Like most other
Paris churches of any importance, St. Eustache had its
secular period. The Feast of Reason was held here in
1793; in 1795 it was the Temple of Agriculture. In
1791 Mirabeau, the first of the illustrious, as we saw, to
be buried in the Panthéon, was carried here in his coffin
for a funeral service, at which guns were fired that
brought down some of the plaster. Voiture the poet
was buried here. The church has always been famous for
the splendour of its festivals and for its music, its present
organ, once much injured by Communard bombs, being
one of the finest in the world. No reader of this book
who cares for solemn music should fail to ascertain
the St. Eustache festivals. On St. Cecilia's day entrance
is very difficult, but an effort should be made.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span></p>

<p>Eustache, or Eustace, the Saint, had no direct association
with Paris, as had our friends St Germain and St.
Geneviève and St. Denis and St. Martin and St. Merry;
but he had an indirect one, having been a Roman
soldier under the Emperor Trajan, whose column was
the model for the Vendôme column. In the Sacristy,
however, are preserved some of the bones not only of
himself but of his wife and family, brought hither from
St. Denis. One of his teeth is here too, and one special
bone, the gift of Pope Alexander VII. to an influential
Catholic.</p>

<p>Why our London markets should be so dull and unattractive
and the Halles so entertaining is a problem
which would perhaps require an ethnological essay of
many pages to elucidate. But so it is. Smithfield,
Billingsgate, Leadenhall, Covent Garden&mdash;one has little
temptation or encouragement to loiter in any of them;
but the Halles spread welcoming arms. I have spent
hours there, and would spend more. In the very early
morning it is not too agreeable a neighbourhood for
the idle spectator, nor is he desired, although if he is
prepared to endure a little rough usage with tongue
and elbow he will be vastly amused by what he sees;
but later, when all the world is up, the Halles entreat
his company. Their phases are three: the first is the
arrival of the market carts with their merchandise, very
much as in our own Covent Garden, but multiplied
many times and infinitely more vocal and shattering to
the nerves.  (I once occupied a bedroom within range
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
of this pandemonium.) The second phase, a few hours
later, sees the descent upon the market of the large
caterers&mdash;buyers for the restaurants, great and small,
the hotels and pensions. That is between half-past five
and half-past seven. And then come the small buyers,
the neat servants, the stout housewives, all with their
baskets or string bags. This is our time; we may now
loiter at our ease secure from the swift and scorching
sarcasms of the crowded dawn.</p>

<p>The Halles furnish another proof of the quiet
efficiency of Frenchwomen. At every fruit and vegetable
stall&mdash;and to me they are the most interesting of
all&mdash;sits one or more of these watchful creatures, cheerful,
capable and always busy either with the affairs of
the stall or with knitting or sewing. The Halles afford
also very practical proof of the place that economy is
permitted to hold in the French cuisine: as much being
done for the small purse as for the large one.</p>

<p>In England we are ashamed of economy; by avoiding
it we hope to give the impression that we are not mean.
The wise French either care less for their neighbour's
opinions or have agreed together to dispense with such
insincerities; and the result is that if a pennyworth of
carrots is all that your soup requires you need not buy two
pennyworth, and so forth. Little portions of vegetables
for one, two or more persons, all ready for the pot,
can be bought, involving no waste whatever, and with
no faltering or excuse on the part of the purchaser to
explain so small an order. In France a customer is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
customer. There are no distinctions; although I do
not deny that in the West End of Paris, where the
Americans and English spend their money, subtle shades
of courtesy (or want of it) have crept in. I have been
treated like a prince in a small comestible shop where
I wanted only a pennyworth of butter, a pennyworth of
cheese and a pennyworth of milk. It is pennies that
make the French rich; no one can be in any doubt of
that who has taken notice of the thousands of small
shops not only in Paris but in the provinces.</p>

<p>Any one making an early morning visit to the Halles
should complete it by seeing my goat-herd, who leads
his flocks thereabouts and eastward. He is the prettiest
sight I ever saw in Paris. There are several goat-herds&mdash;even
Passy knows them&mdash;but my goat-herd is here.
By eight o'clock he has done; his flock is dry. He
wears a blue cloth tam-o'-shanter (if there can be such
a thing: it is really the cap of the romantic mountaineer
of comic opera) and he saunters carelessly along, piping
melancholy notes on a shepherd's pipe&mdash;not unlike the
lovely wailing that desolates the soul in the last act of
<i>Tristan und Isolde</i>. When a customer arrives he calls
one of his goats, sits down on the nearest doorstep&mdash;it
may be a seventeenth-century palace&mdash;and milks a cupful;
and then he is off again, with his scrannel to his
lips, the very type of the urban Strephon.</p>

<p>We may leave les Halles (pronounced lay al, and not,
as one would think, lays all: one of the pitfalls for the
English in Paris) by the Rue Berger, and enter the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
Square des Innocents to look at its decorative fountain.
The next street below the Rue des Innocents is the
Rue de la Ferronnerie, where, on May 14th, 1610,
Henri IV. was assassinated by Ravaillac before the door
of No. 3. And so by the Rue St. Denis, which one is
always glad to enter again, and the Rue de Rivoli, we
come to Saint-Jacques, that grey aged isolated tower
which we have seen so often from the heights and in
the distance. It is a beautiful Gothic building, at the
summit of which is the figure of St. James with his
emblems, the originals of which are at the Cluny. The
tower belonged to the church of St. Jacques-la-Boucherie,
but that being in the way when Napoleon
planned the Rue de Rivoli, it had to go.</p>

<p>The tower has not lately been open to the climbers,
and I have never seen Paris from St. James's side, but
I hope to. Blaise Pascal experimented here in the
density of air; hence the presence of his statue below.
It was also to Pascal, of whom we now think only as an
ironist and wistful theologian, that Paris owes her
omnibuses, for it was he that devised the first, which
began to run on March 18th, 1662, from the Luxembourg
to the Bastille. Pascal owed his conversion to
his escape from a carriage accident on the Pont Neuf.
His grave we saw at St. Etienne-du-Mont.</p>

<p>In crossing the Place de l'Hôtel de Ville one must not
forget that this was once the terrible Place de Grève,
the site of public executions for five centuries. Here
we meet Catherine de Médicis again, for it was by her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
order that after the Massacre of St. Bartholomew the
Huguenots Briquemont and Cavagnes were hanged here,
and here also was executed Captain Montgomery, whom
we are to meet in the next chapter. The foster-sister
of Marie de Médicis was burned alive in the Place de
Grève as a sorcerer; and Ravaillac, after assassinating
Henri IV., here met his end. Among later victims was
the famous Cartouche, of whom Thackeray wrote so
entertainingly.</p>

<p>The Hôtel de Ville is not a building that I for one
should choose to revisit, nor do I indeed advise others
to bother about it at all; but externally at any rate it is
fine, with its golden sentinels on high. Its chief merit
is bulk; but there is a certain interest in observing a
Republican palace of our own time, if only to see how
near it can come to the real thing. A saturnine guide
displays a series of spacious apartments, the principal
attraction of which is their mural painting. All the best
French Royal Academicians (so to speak) of twenty
years ago had a finger in this pie, and their fantasies
sprawl over ceilings and walls. With the exception of
one room, the history of Paris is practically ignored,
allegory being the master vogue. Poetry, Song, Inspiration,
Fame, Ambition, Despair&mdash;all these undraped
ladies may be seen, and many others. Also Electricity
and Steam, Science and Art, distinguishable from their
sisters only by the happy chance that although they
forgot their clothes they did not forget their symbols.</p>

<p class="caption">LE BAISER<br />
<span class="s2">RODIN</span><br />
<span class="s2">(<i>Luxembourg</i>)</span></p></div>

<p>One beautiful thing only did I see, and that was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
large design, perhaps the largest there, of Winter, by
Puvis de Chavannes. But to say that I saw it is an
exaggeration: rather, I was conscious of it. For the
architect of the salon in which Puvis was permitted to
work forgot to light it.</p>

<p>In the historical room there are crowded scenes by
Laurens of the past of Paris&mdash;the hero of which is
Etienne Marcel, whose equestrian statue may be seen
from the windows, under the river façade of the building.
Etienne Marcel, Merchant Provost, controlled Paris
after the disastrous battle of Poictiers, where the King
and the Dauphin were both taken prisoners. Power,
however, made him headstrong, and he was killed by an
assassin.</p>

<p>It is from the Hôtel de Ville that the city of Paris is
administered, with the assistance of the Préfecture de
Police on the island opposite. The Hôtel de Ville contains,
so to speak, the Paris County Council, and I have
been told that no building is so absurdly over-staffed.
That may or may not be true. The high officials do
not at any rate allow business to exclude the finer graces
of life, for in the great hall in which I waited for the
cicerone were long tables on which were some twenty or
thirty baskets containing visiting cards, and open books
containing signatures, and before each basket was a card
bearing the name of an important functionary of the
Hôtel de Ville&mdash;such as the Préfet de la Seine, and the
Sous-Préfet, and their principal secretaries, and so forth.
Every minute or so some one came in, found the basket
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
to which he wished to contribute, and dropped a card
in it. I wondered to what extent the social machinery
of Paris bureaucracy would be disorganised if I were to
change a few baskets, but I did not embark upon an
experiment the results of which I should have had no
means of contemplating and enjoying.</p>

<p>After leaving the Hôtel de Ville and its modern
splendours, we may walk eastward along the Rue de
l'Hôtel de Ville, one of the narrowest and dirtiest relics
of old Paris, and so come to the Hôtel de Sens. But
first notice, at the corner of the Rue des Nonnains-d'Hyères,
at the point at which Mr. Dexter made his
drawing, the very ancient stone sign of the knife-grinder.
The Hôtel de Sens, in the Place de l'Ave Maria, at the
end of the Rue de l'Hôtel de Ville, is almost if not quite
the most attractive of the old palaces. Although it has
been allowed to fall into neglect, it is still a wonderfully
preserved specimen of fifteenth-century building. The
turrets are absolutely beautiful. The Archbishop of
Sens built it, and for nearly three centuries it remained
the home of power and wealth, among its tenants being
Marguerite of Valois. Then came the Revolution and
its decline into a coach office, from which it is said the
Lyons mail, made familiar to us by the Irvings, started.
During a later revolution, 1830, a cannon ball found a
billet in the wall, and it may still be seen there, I am
told, although these eyes missed it. The Hôtel is now
a glass factory. The city of Paris ought to acquire it
before it sinks any lower.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span></p>

<p>It is at the foot of the Rue de l'Ave Maria, hard by,
that Molière's theatre, which we saw from the Quai des
Célestins in an earlier chapter, is found. Here Molière
was arrested at the instance of the unpaid tallow
chandler. Our way now is by the Rue Figuier, of which
the Hôtel de Sens is No. 1, to the Rue François-Miron,
all among the most fascinating old architecture and
association. At No. 8 Rue Figuier, for instance, Rabelais
is said to have lived, and what could be better
than that? At No. 17, we have what the Vicomte de
Villebresme calls a "jolie niche du XV<sup>e</sup> siècle". This
street leads into the Rue de Jouy, also exceedingly old,
with notable buildings, such as No. 7, the work of
Mansard père, and No. 9, and on the left of the Impasse
Guépine, which existed in the reign of Saint Louis.</p>

<p>In the Rue François-Miron, if you do not mind exhibiting
a little inquisitiveness, enter the doorway of
No. 68, and look at the courtyard and the staircase.
Here you get an excellent idea of past glories, while the
outer doors or gates give an excellent idea of past danger
too. For life in Paris in the days in which this street
was built must have been very cheap after dark. It is
not dear even now in certain parts. This was an historic
mansion. It was built for Madame de Beaumaris,
femme de chambre of Anne of Austria, and on its balcony,
now removed, on August 20th, 1660, Anne stood with
Mazarin and others when Louis XIV. entered Paris.
No. 82 still retains a balcony of great charm.</p>

<p>We now enter the very busy Rue St. Antoine at its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
junction with the Rue de Rivoli. Almost immediately
on our right is a gateway leading into a very charming
courtyard, which is not open to the public, but into
which one may gently trespass; it is the school of the
Frères Chrétiens, founded by Frère Joseph, the good
priest with the sweet and sad old face whose bust is on
the wall. A few steps farther bring us to the church
of St. Paul and St. Louis, a florid and imposing fane,
to which Victor Hugo (to whose house we are now
making our way) carried his first child to be christened,
and presented to the church two holy water stoops in
commemoration. Here also Richelieu celebrated his
first mass. One of Delacroix's best early works (we saw
the picture called "Hommage à Delacroix," you will
remember, in the Moreau collection at the Louvre) is
in the left transept, "Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane".
On no account miss the Passage Charlemagne
(close to the St. Paul Station on the Métro) for it is
a curious, busy and very French by-way, and it possesses
the remains of a palace of the fourteenth century. In
the Passage de St. Pierre is the site of the old cemetery
of St. Paul's in which Rabelais was buried.

THE PLACE DES VOSGES AND HUGO'S HOUSE</h2>

A Beautiful Square&mdash;The Palais des Tournelles&mdash;Revolutionary

Life&mdash;A Riot of Relics&mdash;Victorious Versatility&mdash;Dumas' Pen&mdash;The

<p>Were we to walk a little farther along the busy
Rue St. Antoine towards the Place de la
Bastille, we should come, on the left, a few yards past
the church of St. Louis, to the Rue de Birague, at the
head of which is the beautiful red gateway of which Mr.
Dexter has made such a charming picture. This is the
southern gateway of the Place des Vosges, a spacious
green square enclosed by massive red and white houses
of brick and stone which once were the abode, when the
Place des Vosges was the Place Royale, of the aristocracy
of France.</p>

<p>Before that time the courtyard of the old Palais des
Tournelles was here, where Henri II. was killed in a
tournament in 1559, through an accident for which
Captain Montgomery of the Scotch Guard, whose fault
Catherine de Médicis deemed it to be, was executed, as
we have just seen, in the Place de l'Hôtel-de-Ville.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
Catherine de Médicis, not content with thus avenging
her husband's death, demolished the Palais des Tournelles,
and a few years later Henri IV., to whom old
Paris owes so much, built the Place Royale, just as it is
now. His own pavilion was the centre building on the
south side, comprising the gateway which Mr. Dexter
has drawn; the Queen's was the corresponding building
on the north side.</p>

<p>Around dwelt the nobles of the Court&mdash;such at any
rate as were not living in the adjoining Marais. Richelieu's
hotel embraced Nos. 21-23 as they now are. It
was in front of that mansion that the famous duel
between Montmorency-Bouteville and Des Chapelles
against Bussy and Beuvron was fought. The spirit of
the great Dumas, one feels, must haunt this Place: for
it is peopled with ghosts from his brave romances.</p>

<p>The decay of the Place des Vosges began, of course,
when the aristocracy moved over to the Faubourg St.
Germain, although it never sank low. The Revolution
then took it in hand, and naturally began by destroying
the statue of Louis XIII. in the centre, which Richelieu
had set up, while its name was changed from Place
Royale to its present style in honour of the Department
of the Vosges, the first to contribute funds to the new
order. In 1825, under Charles X., Louis XIII. in a
new stone dress returned to his honoured position in
the midst of the square, and all was as it should be once
more, save that no longer did lords and ladies ruffle it
here or in the Marais.

<p class="caption">THE PLACE DES VOSGES<br />
<span class="s2">(SOUTHERN ENTRANCE, &nbsp;IN THE RUE BIRAGUE)</span></p></div>

<p>The most picturesque associations of the Place des
Vosges are historical; but it has at any rate three
houses which have an artistic interest. At No. 1 was
born that gifted and delightful lady in whose home in
later years we have spent such pleasant hours&mdash;Madame
de Sévigné, or as she was in those early days (she was
born in 1626) Marie de Rabutin-Chantal. At No. 13
lived for a while Rachel the tragedienne. According
to Herr Baedeker, who is not often wrong, she died here
too: but other authorities place her death at Carmet,
near Toulon. I like to think that this rare wayward and
terrible creature of emotion was once an inhabitant of
these walls. The third house is No. 6, in the south-eastern
corner, the second floor of which, from 1833 to
1848, was the home of Victor Hugo. It is now a Hugo
museum. Although Hugo occupied only a small portion,
the whole house is now dedicated to his spreading
memory. Let us enter.</p>

<p>There is nothing in England like the Hugo museum.
I have been to Carlyle's house in Cheyne Row; to
Johnson's house at Lichfield; to Wordsworth's house at
Grasmere; to Milton's house at Chalfont St. Giles; to
Leighton's House at Kensington; and the impression
left by all is that their owners lived very thin lives.
The rooms convey a sense of bareness: one is struck
not by the wealth of relics but by the poverty of them;
while for any suggestion that these men were pulsating
creatures of friendship one seeks in vain. But Hugo&mdash;Hugo's
house throbs with life and energy and warm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
prosperous amities. Every inch is crowded with mementoes
of his vigour and his triumphs, yes, and his
failures too.</p>

<p>Here are portraits of him by the hundred, at all ages,
caricatures, lampoons, play bills, first editions, popular
editions, furniture by Hugo, decorations by Hugo,
drawings by Hugo, scenes in Hugo's life in exile,
wreaths, busts, portraits of his grandchildren (who
taught him the exquisite art of being a grandfather), his
death-bed, his death-mask, the cast of his hands. Hugo,
Hugo, everywhere, always tremendous and splendid and
passionate and French.</p>

<p>Among the more valuable possessions of this museum
are Bastien-Lepage's charcoal drawing of the master;
Besnard's picture of the first night of Hernani with the
young romantic on the stage taking his call and hurling
defiance at the gods; Steinlen's oil painting (there are
not many oil paintings by this great draughtsman and
great Parisian) "Les Pauvres Gens"; Daumier's cartoon
"Les Châtiments"; Henner's "Sarah la Baigneuse"
from <i>Les Orientales</i>; allegories by Chifflart; beautiful
canvases by Carrière and Fantin-Latour; and Devambez's
"Jean Valjean before the tribunal of Arras," in which
Jean is curiously like Gladstone in a bad coat; Vierge's
drawing of the funeral of Georges Hugo, during the
siege; and Yama Motto's curious scene of Hugo's own
funeral, of which there are many photographs, including
one of the coffin as it lay in state for two days
under the Arc de Triomphe. There are also a number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
of Hugo relics which the camelots of that day were
selling to the crowds.</p>

<p>Hugo, it is well known, nursed a private ambition to
be a great artist, and in my opinion he was a great
artist. There are on these walls drawings from his hand
which are magnificent&mdash;mysterious and sombre fortresses
on impregnable cliffs, scenes in enchanted lands with
more imagination than ever Doré compassed, and some
of the sinister cruelty and power of Méryon. Hugo
was ingenious too: he decorated a room with coloured
carvings in the Chinese manner and he made the neatest
folding table I ever saw&mdash;hinged into the wall so that
when not in use it takes up no floor-space whatever.</p>

<p>It is amusing to follow Hugo's physiognomy through
the ages, at first beardless, looking when young rather
like Bruant, the chansonnier of to-day; then the coming
of the beard, and the progress of it until the final stage
in which the mental eye now always sees the old poet&mdash;white
and strong and benevolent&mdash;the Hugo, in short,
of Bonnat's famous portrait.</p>

<p>On a table is a collection of literary souvenirs of
intense interest: Hugo's pen and inkstand, and the
great Dumas' pen presented to Hugo in 1860 after
writing with it his last "15 or 20" volumes (fifteen <i>or</i>
twenty&mdash;how like him!); Lamartine's inkstand, offered
"to the master of the pen"; George Sand's match-box
for those endless cigarettes, and with it her travelling
inkstand. In another room upstairs are the six pens
used by Hugo in writing <i>Les Humbles</i>. Dumas' pen is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
not by any means the only Dumas relic here; portraits
of him are to be seen, one of them astonishingly negroid.
Had he too worked for liberty and carried in his breast
or even on his sleeve a great heart that, like Hugo's,
responded to every call and beat furiously at the very
whisper of the word injustice, he too would have his
museum to-day not less remarkable than this. But to
write romances was not enough: there must be toil
and suffering too.</p>

<p>Dumas and Hugo were born in the same year, 1802:
Balzac was then three. In 1809 came Tennyson and
Gladstone; in 1811 Thackeray and in 1812 Browning
and Dickens. What was the secret of that astounding
period? Why did the first twelve years of the last
century know such energy and abundance? To walk
through the rooms of this Hugo museum, however
casually, is to be amazed before the vitality and exuberance
not only of this man but of the French genius. It
is truly only the busy who have time. I wish none the
less that there was a museum for Alexandre the Great.
I would love to visit it: I would love to see his kitchen
utensils alone. The generous glorious creature, "the
seven and seventy times to be forgiven"! As it was,
no one being about, I kissed the pen with which he had
written his last "15 or 20" novels (the splendid liar!).</p>

<p>I wish too that we had a permanent Dickens' museum
in London&mdash;say at his house in Devonshire Terrace,
which is now a lawyer's office. What a fascinating
memorial of Merry England it might become, and what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
a reminder to this attenuated specialising day of the
vigour and versatility and variety and inconquerable
vivacity of that giant! Just as no one can leave Hugo's
house without a quickening of imagination and ambition,
so no one could leave that of Charles Dickens.</p>

<p>In addition to this museum Hugo has his monument
in the Place Victor Hugo, far away in a residential desert
in the north-west of Paris, a bronze figure of the poet as
a young man seated on a rock, with Satire, Lyric Poetry
and Fame attending him; while on the façade of the
house where he died, No. 124 Avenue Victor Hugo, is a
medallion portrait. He figures also in a fresco in the
Hôtel de Ville. Dumas' monument is in the garden of
the Place Malesherbes in the Avenue de Villiers. Doré
designed it, as was perhaps fitting. The sturdy Alexandre
sits, pen in hand, on the summit, his West Indian
hair curling vigorously into the sky, with d'Artagnan
and three engrossed readers at the base. It is not quite
what one would have wished; but it is good to visit.
His son, the dramatist, the author of that adorable joke
against his father's vanity&mdash;that he was capable of riding
behind his own carriage to persuade people that he kept
a black servant&mdash;has a monument close by; and the
gallant general of whom one reads such brave stories in
the first volume of the <i>Mémoires</i> is to be set there too,
and then the Place, I am told, will be re-named the
Place des Trois Dumas.

THE BASTILLE, PÈRE LACHAISE AND THE END</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span></p>
<p class="blockquot">
A Thoughtful Municipality&mdash;The Fall of the Bastille&mdash;Revolt and
Revolution&mdash;The Column of July&mdash;A Paris Canal&mdash;Deliberate
Building&mdash;The Buttes-Chaumont&mdash;A City of the Dead&mdash;Père
la Chaise&mdash;Bartholomé's Monument&mdash;The Cimetière de Mont
Parnasse&mdash;The Country round Paris&mdash;What we have Missed&mdash;Conclusion.</p>

<p>The Place des Vosges is close to the Place de la Bastille,
which lies to the east of it along the Rue St.
Antoine. The prison has gone for ever, but one is assisted
by a thoughtful municipality to reconstruct it, a
task of no difficulty at all if one remembers with any
vividness the models in the Carnavalet or the Archives,
or buys a pictorial postcard at any neighbouring shop.
The contribution of the pious city fathers is a map on
the façade of No. 36 Place de la Bastille, and a permanent
outline of the walls of the dreadful building inlaid
in the road and pavement, which one may follow
step by step to the satisfaction of one's imagination and
the derangement of the traffic until it disappears into
cafés and shops. One has to remember, however, that
the surface of the ground was much lower, the prison
being surrounded by a moat and gained only by bridges.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
For the actual stones one must go to the Pont de la
Concorde, the upper part of which was built of them in
1790.</p>

<p>The Bastille's end came in 1789, at the beginning of
the Revolution, on the day after the National Guard
was established, when the people of Paris rose under
Camille Desmoulins and captured it, thus not only displaying
but discovering their strength. Carlyle was
never more scornful, never more cruelly vivid, than in
his description of this event. I must quote a little, it
is so horribly splendid: "To describe this Siege of the
Bastille (thought to be one of the most important in
History) perhaps transcends the talent of mortals.
Could one but, after infinite reading, get to understand
so much as the plan of the building! But there is open
Esplanade, at the end of the Rue Saint-Antoine; there
are such Forecourts, <i>Cour Avanceé, Cour de l'Orme</i>,
arched Gateway (where Louis Tournay now fights);
then new drawbridges, dormant-bridges, rampart-bastions,
and the grim Eight Towers: a labyrinthic Mass,
high-frowning there, of all ages from twenty years to
four hundred and twenty;&mdash;beleaguered, in this its last
hour, as we said, by mere Chaos come again! Ordnance
of all calibres; throats of all capacities; men of all
plans, every man his own engineer: seldom since the
war of Pygmies and Cranes was there seen so anomalous
a thing. Half-pay Elie is home for a suit of regimentals;
no one would heed him in coloured clothes:
half-pay Hulin is haranguing Gardes Françaises in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
Place de Grève. Frantic Patriots pick up the grapeshots;
bear them, still hot (or seemingly so), to the
Hôtel-de-Ville:&mdash;Paris, you perceive, is to be burnt!
Flesselles is 'pale to the very lips'; for the roar of the
multitude grows deep. Paris wholly has got to the
acme of its frenzy; whirled, all ways, by panic madness.
At every street-barricade, there whirls simmering a
minor whirlpool,&mdash;strengthening the barricade, since God
knows what is coming; and all minor whirlpools play
distractedly into that grand Fire-Maelstrom which is
lashing round the Bastille.</p>

<p>"And so it lashes and it roars. Cholat the wine-merchant
has become an impromptu cannoneer. See
Georget, of the Marine Service, fresh from Brest, ply
the King of Siam's cannon. Singular (if we were not
used to the like): Georget lay, last night, taking his
ease at his inn; the King of Siam's cannon also lay,
knowing nothing of <i>him</i>, for a hundred years. Yet
now, at the right instant, they have got together, and
discourse eloquent music. For, hearing what was toward,
Georget sprang from the Brest Diligence, and
ran. Gardes Françaises also will be here, with real
artillery: were not the walls so thick!&mdash;Upwards from
the Esplanade, horizontally from all neighbouring roofs
and windows, flashes one irregular deluge of musketry,
without effect. The Invalides lie flat, firing comparatively
at their ease from behind stone; hardly through
portholes show the tip of a nose. We fall, shot; and
make no impression!

<p>"Let conflagration rage; of whatsoever is combustible!
Guard-rooms are burnt, Invalides mess-rooms.
A distracted 'Perukemaker with two fiery torches' is
for burning 'the saltpetres of the Arsenal';&mdash;had not
a woman run screaming; had not a Patriot, with some
tincture of Natural Philosophy, instantly struck the
wind out of him (butt of musket on pit of stomach),
overturned barrels, and stayed the devouring element.
A young beautiful lady, seized escaping in these Outer
Courts, and thought falsely to be De Launay's daughter,
shall be burnt in De Launay's sight; she lies swooned
on a paillasse: but again a Patriot, it is brave Aubin
Bonnemère the old soldier, dashes in, and rescues her.
Straw is burnt; three cartloads of it, hauled thither, go
up in white smoke: almost to the choking of Patriotism
itself; so that Elie had, with singed brows, to drag
back one cart; and Réole the 'gigantic haberdasher'
another. Smoke as of Tophet; confusion as of Babel;
noise as of the Crack of Doom!</p>

<p>"Blood flows; the aliment of new madness. The
wounded are carried into houses of the Rue Cerisaie;
the dying leave their last mandate not to yield till the
accursed Stronghold fall. And yet, alas, how fall? The
walls are so thick! Deputations, three in number, arrive
from the Hôtel-de-Ville; Abbé Fauchet (who was of
one) can say, with what almost superhuman courage of
benevolence. These wave their Town-flag in the arched
Gateway; and stand, rolling their drum; but to no
purpose. In such Crack of Doom De Launay cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
hear them, dare not believe them: they return, with
justified rage, the whew of lead still singing in their
ears. What to do? The Firemen are here, squirting
with their fire-pumps on the Invalides cannon, to wet
the touchholes; they unfortunately cannot squirt so
high; but produce only clouds of spray. Individuals
of classical knowledge propose <i>catapults</i>. Santerre, the
sonorous Brewer of the Suburb Saint-Antoine, advises
rather that the place be fired, by a 'mixture of phosphorus
and of oil-of-turpentine spouted up through
forcing-pumps': O Spinola-Santerre, hast thou the
mixture <i>ready</i>? Every man his own engineer! And
still the fire-deluge abates not: even women are firing,
and Turks; at least one woman (with her sweetheart),
and one Turk. Gardes Françaises have come: real cannon,
real cannoneers. Usher Maillard is busy; half-pay
Elie, half-pay Hulin rage in the midst of thousands.</p>

<p>"How the great Bastille Clock ticks (inaudible) in its
Inner Court there, at its ease, hour after hour; as if
nothing special, for it or the world, were passing! It
tolled One when the firing began; and is now pointing
towards Five, and still the firing slakes not.&mdash;Far down,
in their vaults, the seven Prisoners hear muffled din as
of earthquakes; their Turnkeys answer vaguely.</p>

<p>"Wo to thee, De Launay, with thy poor hundred
Invalides! Broglie is distant, and his ears heavy:
Besenval hears, but can send no help. One poor troop
of Hussars has crept, reconnoitering, cautiously along
the Quais, as far as the Pont Neuf. 'We are come to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
join you,' said the Captain; for the crowd seem shoreless.
A large-headed dwarfish individual, of smoke-bleared
aspect, shambles forward, opening his blue lips, for there
is sense in him; and croaks: 'Alight then, and give
up your arms!' The Hussar-Captain is too happy to
be escorted to the Barriers, and dismissed on parole.
Who the squat individual was? Men answer, It is M.
Marat, author of the excellent pacific <i>Avis au Peuple</i>!
Great truly, O thou remarkable Dogleech, is this thy
day of emergence and new-birth: and yet this same day
come four years&mdash;!&mdash;But let the curtains of the Future
hang."</p>

<p>After some hours the deed is done and Paris re-echoes
to the cries "La Bastille est prise!" "In the Court,
all is mystery, not without whisperings of terror; though
ye dream of lemonade and epaulettes, ye foolish women!
His Majesty, kept in happy ignorance, perhaps dreams
of double-barrels and the Woods of Meudon. Late at
night, the Duke de Liancourt, having official right of
entrance, gains access to the Royal Apartments; unfolds,
with earnest clearness, in his constitutional way, the
Job's-news. '<i>Mais</i>,' said poor Louis, '<i>c'est une révolte</i>,
Why, that is a revolt!'&mdash;'Sire,' answered Liancourt, 'it
is not a revolt,&mdash;it is a revolution.'"</p>

<p>That was July 14th, 1789; but it is not the July that
the Colonne de Juillet in the centre of the Place celebrates.
That July was forty-one years later, not so late
but that many Parisians could remember both events.
July 27th to 29th, 1830, the Second Revolution, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
overturned the Bourbons and set Louis-Philippe of
Orleans in the siège périlleux of France. Louis-Philippe
himself erected this monument in memory of the six
hundred and fifteen citizens who fell in his interests and
who are buried beneath. Their names are cut in the
bronze of the column, on the summit of which is the
beautiful winged figure of Liberty.</p>

<p>Beneath the vault of the Colonne, and immediately
beneath the Colonne itself, runs the great canal which
brings merchandise into Paris from the east, entering
the Seine between the Pont Sully and the Pont d'Austerlitz.
At this point it is not very interesting, but from
the Avenue de la République, where it re-emerges again
into the light of day, and thence right away to the Abattoirs
de Villette, it is very amusing to stroll by. The
Paris <i>Daily Mail</i>, which in its eager paternal way has
taken English and American visitors completely under
its wing, is diurnally anxious that its readers should
make a tour of these abattoirs. But not I. That a
holiday in Paris should include the examination of a
slaughter-house strikes me as a joyless proposition, putting
thoroughness far before pleasure. But the <i>Daily
Mail</i> is like that; it also does its best on the second and
fourth Wednesdays in every month to get its compatriots
down the Paris sewers. And I suppose they go. Strange
heart of the tourist! We never think of penetrating
either to the sewers or the slaughter-houses of our native
land; we have no theories of sewers, no data for comparison;
we love the upper air and the sun. But being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
in a foreign city we cheerfully give the second or fourth
Wednesday to such delights.</p>

<p>Having taken the <i>Daily Mail's</i> advice and visited the
abattoirs (which I have not done), one cannot do better
than return to Paris by way of the canal, sauntering
beside it all the way to the Rue Faubourg du Temple,
where one passes into the Place de la République and
the stir of the city once more. The canal descends
from the heights of La Villette in a series of long steps,
as it were (or, to take the most dissonant simile possible
to devise, like the lakes at Wootton), built up by locks.
Idling by this canal one sees many agreeable phases of
human toil. Many commodities and materials reach
Paris by barge, and it is on these quais and in the
Villette basin that the unloading is done; while the
barges themselves are pleasant spectacles&mdash;so long and
clean and broad&mdash;very Mauretanias beside the barges of
Holland&mdash;with spacious deck-houses that are often perfect
villas, the wife and children watering the flowers at
the door.</p>

<p>One quai is given up wholly to lime. This arrives in
thousands of little solid sacks which stevedores whiter
than millers transfer to the carts, that, in their turn,
creak off to disorganise the traffic of a hundred streets
and provoke the contempt of a thousand drivers before
they reach their destined building, on which the workmen
have already been engaged for two years and will
be engaged for two years more. There is no hurry
in constructional work in Paris&mdash;except of course on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
Exhibitions, which spring up in a night. The same piece
of road that was up in the Rue Lafayette for some surface
trouble in a recent April, I found still up in October.
But they have the grace, when rebuilding a house in
the city, to hide their deliberate processes behind a
wooden screen&mdash;such a screen as was opposite the Café
de la Paix, at the south-east corner of the Boulevard
des Capucines, for, it seems to me, years.</p>

<p>If, however, one is walking beside the canal in the
other direction, up the hill instead of down, one will
soon be nearer the Victoria Park of Paris, the park of
the east end, than at any other time, and this should
be visited as surely as the abattoirs should be avoided:
unless, of course, one is a well-informed or thoughtful
butcher. We have seen the Parc Monceau; well, the
antithesis of the Parc Monceau, which has no counter-part
in London, is the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont.
Both are children's paradises, the only difference in the
children being social position. The Parc des Buttes-Chaumont
is sixty acres of trees and walks and perpendicular
rocks and water, the special charm of which is
its diversified character, rising in the midst to an immense
height made easy for carriages and perambulators by a
winding road. It has a deep gorge crossed by a suspension
bridge, a lake for boats, a cascade, and thousands
of chairs side by side, touching, lining the roads, on
which the maids and matrons of La Villette and Belleville
sew and gossip, while the children play around. The
parc was made in the sixties: before then it had been a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
waste ground and gypsum quarry&mdash;hence its attractive
irregularities. How wonderful the heights and cathedral
of Montmartre can appear from one of the peaks of the
Buttes-Chaumont, Mr. Dexter's drawing shows.</p>

<p>The Buttes-Chaumont is the most easterly point we
have yet reached; but there is another parc more
easterly still awaiting us, not unlike the Buttes-Chaumont
in its acclivities, but unlike it in this particular,
that it is a parc not of the living but the dead. I mean
Père Lachaise. Père Lachaise! What kind of an old
man do you think gave his name to this cemetery?
Most persons, I imagine, see him as white-haired and
venerable: not twinkling, like Papa Gontier, but serene
and noble and sad. As a matter of fact he was a père
only by profession and courtesy. Père Lachaise was
Louis XIV.'s fashionable confessor (Landor has a diverting
imaginary conversation between these two), and the
cemetery took its name from his house, which chanced to
occupy the site of the present chapel. The ground was
enclosed as a burial ground as recently as 1804, which
means of course that the famous tomb of Abélard and
Héloise, to which all travellers find their way, is a
modern reconstruction. The remains of La Fontaine
and Molière and other illustrious men who died before
1804 were transferred here, just as Zola's were recently
transferred from the cemetery of Montmartre to the
Panthéon, but with less excitement.</p>

<p>Père Lachaise cannot be taken lightly. The French
live very thoroughly, but when they die they die
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
thoroughly too, and their cemeteries confess the scythe.
There may be, to our thinking, too much architecture;
but it is serious. There is no mountebanking (as at
Genoa), nor is there any whining, as in some of our own
churchyards. Death to a Frenchman is a fact and a
mystery, to be faced when the time comes, if not before,
and to be honoured. On certain festivals of the year there
are a thousand mourners to every acre of Père Lachaise.</p>

<p>The natural entrance is by the Rue de la Roquette,
but it is less fatiguing to enter at the top, at the new
gate in the Avenue du Père Lachaise, and walk downhill;
for the paths are steep and the cemetery covers
a hundred acres and more. The objection to this course
is that one loses some of the sublimity of Bartholomé's
<i>Monument aux Morts</i> at the foot of the mountain on
which the chapel stands. This monument faces the
principal entrance with the careful design of impressing
the visitor, and its impact can be tremendous. We
approach it by the Avenue Principale, in which lies
Alfred de Musset, with the willow waving over his tomb
and his own lines upon it.</p>

<p>And then one enters seriously upon this strange pilgrimage
among names and memories. Chopin lies here,
his music stilled, and Talma the tragedian; Beaumarchais
and Maréchal Ney; Cherubini and Alphonse
Daudet; Balzac, his pen for ever idle, and Delacroix;
Béranger, who made the nation's ballads, and Brillat-Savarin,
all his dinners eaten; Michelet, the historian,
and Planquette, the composer of <i>Les Cloches de Corneville</i>;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
Daumier, the great artist who saw to the heart of things,
and Corot, who befriended Daumier's last years; Daubigny
and Rosa Bonheur, Thiers and Scribe; Rachel,
once so very living, and many Rothschilds now poorer
than I.</p>

<p>Paris has other cemeteries, as we know, for we have
walked through that of Montmartre; but there is also
the Cimetière de Montparnasse, where lie Sainte-Beuve
and Leconte de Lisle, Théodore de Banville, master of
<i>vers de société</i>, and Fantin-Latour, Baudelaire (lying
beneath a figure of the Genius of Evil), and Barbey
d'Aurevilly, the dandy-novelist. There are also the
cemeteries of Passy and Picpus, but into these I have
never wandered. Lafayette lies at Picpus, which is behind
a convent in the Rue de Picpus, and costs fifty centimes
to see, and there also were buried many victims of the
guillotine besides those whose bodies were flung into
the earth behind the Madeleine.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>All the space at my disposal has been required by
Paris itself; and such is the human interest that at any
rate in the older parts clings to every stone and saturates
the soil, that I do not know that I have had any temptation
to rove beyond the fortifications. But that of
course is not right. No one really knows the Parisians
until he sees them in happy summer mood in one of
the pleasure resorts on the Seine, or winning money at
Enghien, or lunching in one of the tree-top restaurants
at Robinson. We have indeed been curiously unenterprising,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
and it is all owing to the fascination of Paris herself
and the narrow dimensions of this book. We have
not even been to St. Denis, to stand among the ashes
of the French kings; we have not descended the formal
slopes of St. Cloud; we have not peeped into Corot's
little chapel at Ville d'Avray; we have not seen the
home of Sèvres porcelain; we have not scaled Mont-Valérien;
we have not taken boat for Marly-le-Roi; we
have not wandered marvelling but weary amid the battle
scenes of Versailles, or smiled at the pretty fopperies of
the hamlet of the Petit Trianon. We have not known
the groves either of the Bois de Vincennes or the Bois de
Meudon.</p>

<p>Much less have we fed those guzzling gourmands,
the carp of Chantilly, or lost ourselves before the little
Raphael there, or the curious Leonardo sketch for La
Joconde, or the sweet simplicities of the pretty Jean
Fouquet illuminations, particularly the domestic solicitude
of the ladies attending upon the birth of John the
Baptist; less still have we forgotten the restlessness and
urgency of Paris amid the allées and rochers of the
Forest of Fontainebleau, and the still white streets of
Barbizon, or even on the steps of the château where the
Great Emperor, thoughts of whom are never very distant&mdash;are
indeed too near&mdash;bade farewell to his Old
Guard in 1814.</p>

<p>Greater Paris, it will be gathered, is hardly less interesting
than Paris herself; and indeed how pleasant
it would be to write about it! But not here.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span></p>

<p>Of Paris within the fortifications have I, I wonder,
conveyed any of the fascination, the variety, the colour,
the self-containment. I hope so. I hope too that at
any rate these pages have implanted in a few readers
the desire to see this beautiful and efficient city for
themselves, and even more should I value the knowledge
that they had excited in others who are not
strangers to Paris the wish to be there again. To do
justice to such a city, with such a history, is of course
an impossibility. What, however, should not be impossible
is to create a goût.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
